Heart disease accounted for nearly 700,000 out of the total of 3.46 million deaths in 2021.&amp;nbsp;
Some groups have a tougher battle with heart disease than others:&amp;nbsp;
Men have almost a 62% higher rate of death from heart disease than women do.
Black individuals have higher rates of heart disease and high blood pressure (hypertension) than the rest of the population.</description></item><item><title>A Nightmare Unleashed: The Shocking Reality of Medical Identity Mix-ups</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/a-nightmare-unleashed-the-shocking-reality-of-medical-identity-mix-ups/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/a-nightmare-unleashed-the-shocking-reality-of-medical-identity-mix-ups/</guid><description>A few years ago, Painter Law Firm represented a woman in her 70s who lived in a Houston suburb. Let&amp;#39;s refer to her as Sarah.
Sarah was a delightful lady with a grandmotherly smile that brightened everyone&amp;#39;s day. Prior to hiring our firm, she underwent abdominal surgery and was scheduled for a short stay in a skilled nursing facility (SNF) to recover and regain strength before returning home. Despite some hearing difficulties, Sarah led an independent life and was generally healthy.</description></item><item><title>The importance of preoperative medical evaluation: Lessons from medical malpractice cases</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-importance-of-preoperative-medical-evaluation-lessons-from-medical-malpractice-cases/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-importance-of-preoperative-medical-evaluation-lessons-from-medical-malpractice-cases/</guid><description>The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) recently published the results of a Canadian study that concluded that a preoperative consultation with a medical specialist isn&amp;#39;t associated with a better outcome after surgery.

Options for foot and ankle treatment
When seeking surgical care for foot and ankle issues, patients have two options.
Podiatrists are surgeons who specialize in surgery and medical care (non-surgical) for the ankle and foot. The practice of podiatrists overlaps with that of orthopedic surgeons who specialize in the same parts of body.</description></item><item><title>3 reasons you may not want to wait and see what happens after a surgical complication</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/3-reasons-you-may-not-want-to-wait-and-see-what-happens-after-a-surgical-complication/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/3-reasons-you-may-not-want-to-wait-and-see-what-happens-after-a-surgical-complication/</guid><description>When a patient experiences a surgical complication, it&amp;rsquo;s common for the surgeon to advise allowing some time for the body to heal and return to normal.
This isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily bad advice, but there are definitely some other considerations to keep in mind. In fact, in some situations, waiting can create other problems down the line.

When I think back to those years, I recall meetings. Lots of meetings.
Hospitals have numerous committees. Quality improvement. Accreditation. Peer review. Whatever the name, the overarching purpose of hospital committees is to improve patient safety in some shape or form.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I found the news about a hospital hiring an independent, external review of its cardiac surgery program so interesting.</description></item><item><title>Houston hospital discharges man with post-operative internal bleeding</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/houston-hospital-discharges-man-with-post-operative-internal-bleeding/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/houston-hospital-discharges-man-with-post-operative-internal-bleeding/</guid><description>A middle-aged man was visiting Houston, Texas for work when he suddenly had severe abdominal pain. Let&amp;rsquo;s call him Leonard.
After the pain, nausea, and vomiting didn&amp;rsquo;t go away for two days, Leonard went to a local hospital emergency room (ER) to get checked out. The ER physician ordered an abdominal CT scan, which showed that Leonard had acute appendicitis, which fortunately had not perforated or formed an abscess.
Leonard was admitted to the hospital and seen by a general surgeon the same day, who decided to take him to the operating room to perform a laparoscopic appendectomy.</description></item><item><title>When you should consider getting a medical or surgical second opinion</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/when-you-should-consider-getting-a-medical-or-surgical-second-opinion/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/when-you-should-consider-getting-a-medical-or-surgical-second-opinion/</guid><description>Each physician or surgeon has a unique perspective, based on his or her education, training, and experience. And that perspective guides recommendations for a patient&amp;rsquo;s plan of care.
This is one reason why considering a second opinion on elective or non-emergency medical or surgical care is often a good idea.
Another reason we see from time to time is that some physicians, surgeons, and providers seem eager to proceed with the costliest, often invasive, treatment before trying other more conservative approaches.</description></item><item><title>Surgeon, nurses miss signs of cauda equina syndrome</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surgeon-nurses-miss-signs-of-cauda-equina-syndrome/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surgeon-nurses-miss-signs-of-cauda-equina-syndrome/</guid><description>A man in his 20s went to see an orthopedic surgeon after having back pain that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t go away. Let&amp;rsquo;s call him Joe.
The surgeon ordered CT and MRI scans of his lower back, or lumbar spine. The scans showed that Joe had a herniated disc at the level of L3&amp;ndash;L4 and spinal stenosis.
&amp;bull; The spinal vertebrae are separated by flexible cushions called discs. When a disc slips out of place it&amp;rsquo;s described as a herniated disc and can cause pain and other symptoms by compressing or pinching a nerve.</description></item><item><title>How to avoid unnecessary spine surgery</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-to-avoid-unnecessary-spine-surgery/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-to-avoid-unnecessary-spine-surgery/</guid><description>A San Antonio spine surgeon is in hot water after a health insurance company sued him in federal court for operating on over 300 patients who didn&amp;rsquo;t need a spine procedure or surgery. According to the lawsuit, the surgeon recommended unnecessary spinal injections, microdiscectomies, anterior cervical discectomies, and fusions.
The lawsuit claims that the patients&amp;rsquo; medical records were basically identical, containing boilerplate language that was nonspecific to the patients&amp;rsquo; conditions and revealing patterns that just aren&amp;rsquo;t credible.</description></item><item><title>$17.5 million to plaintiffs in femoral nerve malpractice case</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/17.5-million-to-plaintiffs-in-femoral-nerve-malpractice-case/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/17.5-million-to-plaintiffs-in-femoral-nerve-malpractice-case/</guid><description>A man in his 30s went to an operating room for surgery to remove a hernia mesh.

1. In the short-term after a bariatric weight loss surgery, pay attention and be vocal about pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. They could be telltale signs that something is wrong.
2.

That's why over a quarter of a million Americans every year choose to have a bariatric weight loss surgery.
Years ago, I asked a nationally known bariatric surgery expert about his thoughts on the growing trend of weight loss surgery.

Known risks are things that can happen even when care is appropriate and no negligence was involved. Theyâ€™re usually detailed in the informed consent paperwork that patients are asked to sign before care begins.
For example, when a patient has a hysterectomy, itâ€™s a known risk that the ureter can be damaged, resulting in a leak of urine into the patientâ€™s peritoneal cavity.</description></item><item><title>Neurosurgeons face class action lawsuit alleging unnecessary spine surgeries</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/neurosurgeons-face-class-action-lawsuit-alleging-unnecessary-spine-surgeries/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/neurosurgeons-face-class-action-lawsuit-alleging-unnecessary-spine-surgeries/</guid><description>â€œIf your only toolâ€™s a hammer, then everything looks like a nail.â€

What are the basics of laparoscopic surgery?
Unlike conventional open-approach abdominal surgeries that require one or more large incisions, the hallmark of laparoscopic surgery is small incisions. The small incisions are why laparoscopic surgeries are often described as being minimally invasive.
In all abdominal laparoscopic procedures, there is a primary incision of around one-half an inch near the belly button.</description></item><item><title>What procedures have the highest death rates in ambulatory surgery centers?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-procedures-have-the-highest-death-rates-in-ambulatory-surgery-centers/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-procedures-have-the-highest-death-rates-in-ambulatory-surgery-centers/</guid><description>Ambulatory surgery centers are a relatively new concept. Before their emergence in the market, patients only had one option for operating room and surgical services, a hospital.
Now, outpatient or ambulatory surgical centers are seemingly everywhere. From a financial perspective, these non-hospital operating room setups are touted for their cost savings.
For sure, they benefit insurance companies because they are less expensive than the hospitals. In fact, if you have health insurance and schedule surgery, your insurance company may call to encourage you to select a freestanding surgery facility rather than the hospital, to save money.</description></item><item><title>Gall bladder surgery and common bile duct injury negligence</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/gall-bladder-surgery-and-common-bile-duct-injury-negligence/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/gall-bladder-surgery-and-common-bile-duct-injury-negligence/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen firsthand what someone with a gallbladder problem feels like.
The gallbladder is a small organ under the liver that plays a role in digestion. Gallbladder pain typically has a sudden onset, centered in the upper right part of the abdomen. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, fever or chills, and an overall feeling that something is terribly wrong. Some people start hyperventilating, which only makes the overall sensation worse.</description></item><item><title>Surgical patients may require anticoagulation medications because of DVT risk</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surgical-patients-may-require-anticoagulation-medications-because-of-dvt-risk/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surgical-patients-may-require-anticoagulation-medications-because-of-dvt-risk/</guid><description>A significant risk of virtually any major surgery is developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs.

The danger of DVTs happens if part of the blood clot breaks off. The traveling clot is called an embolism. More particularly, it&amp;rsquo;s called a pulmonary embolism if the dislodged blood clot reaches the lungs, where it can cause the deadly complication of disrupting blood flow to the lungs and heart.</description></item><item><title>Houston dermatologist and his so-called cosmetic surgery center lose medical malpractice appeal</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/houston-dermatologist-and-his-so-called-cosmetic-surgery-center-lose-medical-malpractice-appeal/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/houston-dermatologist-and-his-so-called-cosmetic-surgery-center-lose-medical-malpractice-appeal/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m spending the day in depositions in a pending cosmetic surgery malpractice case in the Dallas Fort Worth (DFW) area.

What is a neurosurgeon?
First, though, let&amp;rsquo;s address the question: What is a neurosurgeon?
Neurosurgeons are physicians with significant specialty training on how to diagnose and surgically treat disorders of the central and peripheral nervous system. In my experience, neurosurgeons typically focus their practice on one of three areas: the brain, spinal cord, or peripheral nervous system.</description></item><item><title>The risks of Texas plastic/cosmetic surgery tourism</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-risks-of-texas-plastic/cosmetic-surgery-tourism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-risks-of-texas-plastic/cosmetic-surgery-tourism/</guid><description>Of all the medical specialties that we encounter in handling Texas medical malpractice claims, there&amp;rsquo;s one that&amp;rsquo;s a true outlier: plastic/cosmetic surgery.
Even with all the changes in modern health care, physicians and surgeons in most medical specialties are typically rather old school.

What is the esophagus?
The esophagus is a muscular tube for the transport of food and liquids from the throat to the gastrointestinal tract. It&amp;rsquo;s located anterior (in front of) the spinal column and posterior (behind) the trachea, or windpipe.
How can the esophagus get perforated in the operating room?

The risks of problems that can occur even with proper care are called known complications. When a known complication occurs, surgeons and other healthcare providers are often quick to point out that &amp;ldquo;these things unfortunately happen.</description></item><item><title>Res ipsa loquitur in Texas medical malpractice cases</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/res-ipsa-loquitur-in-texas-medical-malpractice-cases/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/res-ipsa-loquitur-in-texas-medical-malpractice-cases/</guid><description>Res ipsa loquitur is a common law legal doctrine that allows the jury to rely on circumstantial evidence to conclude that the defendant&amp;rsquo;s conduct was negligent.
Under Texas law, there are three requirements necessary to establish the res ipsa loquitur doctrine:
&amp;bull; The occurrence wouldn&amp;rsquo;t ordinarily happen in the absence of negligence.
&amp;bull; The instrumentality causing the injury was in the sole control of the defendant.

When it comes to doing the surgical time-out, the more the merrier.

Let&amp;rsquo;s start with why we have informed consent paperwork in the first place.

This involves a surgeon physically removing the visible tumor plus sufficient margins of healthy-appearing tissue around the tumor to remove cancer cells that aren&amp;rsquo;t visible to the naked eye.
This requires a careful balance.

One of the significant differences is a heightened standard of proof in some types of claims.
Texas Civil Practice &amp;amp; Remedies Code Section 74.153 mandates a standard of proof called “willful and wanton negligence” for certain emergency medical care cases. If you’re confused by what that means, join the club.

Urologists perform their own detailed assessments and often use lab work and diagnostic radiology tools, such as CT scans, MRI scans, and ultrasounds, to make a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.</description></item><item><title>Medical device failure can cause brain injury</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/medical-device-failure-can-cause-brain-injury/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/medical-device-failure-can-cause-brain-injury/</guid><description>The bulk of medical malpractice cases involve a doctor, surgeon, or nurse doing the wrong thing or not doing the right thing, in violation of the standard of care.

When looking at all medical specialties, orthopedic surgeons are the second-most often named as defendants in medical malpractice lawsuits.
The most common allegations for substandard care against orthopedic surgeons include:
&amp;bull; Mistakes in performing the surgery itself account for 85% of orthopedic surgery medical negligence claims. This is a broad category and includes allegations such as an unintended nerve or vascular injury during surgery or placing the wrong size prosthesis (for example, hip or knee), which can cause stability problems or failure of the surgery.</description></item><item><title>Study uncovers the most common types of surgical medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/study-uncovers-the-most-common-types-of-surgical-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/study-uncovers-the-most-common-types-of-surgical-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>As a former hospital administrator, I know that one of the best information tools available to hospital leaders interested in improving patient care and safety is to study past events of poor care.
Accreditation standards require all hospitals&amp;nbsp;to do this. Under certain circumstances, hospitals are required to perform a root cause analysis and document a plan on how to prevent the same error from occurring in the future.
Unfortunately, the powerful hospital lobbyists convinced Texas legislators to grant broad privileges to hospitals to keep this information secret from the public, including attorneys, parties to litigation, and courts.</description></item><item><title>Nurse practitioner botches cauda equina syndrome diagnosis, discharges patient from ER</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/nurse-practitioner-botches-cauda-equina-syndrome-diagnosis-discharges-patient-from-er/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/nurse-practitioner-botches-cauda-equina-syndrome-diagnosis-discharges-patient-from-er/</guid><description>One of the challenges facing physicians and nurses in an emergency room setting is that patients come in with symptoms that often can be explained by several medical conditions. Some of these conditions may be extremely common and routine, while others are less common but dangerous and severe when present.
In these situations, the standard of care requires the physician, nurse practitioner, or physician&amp;rsquo;s assistant to create a differential diagnosis list of every possible diagnosis that could explain the patient&amp;rsquo;s problems.</description></item><item><title>Research shows that surgery centers aren't as safe as hospital operating rooms</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/research-shows-that-surgery-centers-arent-as-safe-as-hospital-operating-rooms/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/research-shows-that-surgery-centers-arent-as-safe-as-hospital-operating-rooms/</guid><description>USA Today reports that over 60% of all surgeries, operations, and procedures are now being handled at independent surgery centers, rather than hospitals.

As I read the news story, I immediately thought to myself that I bet two things were involved. Sadly, I was correct on both of them.
Office-based versus hospital operating rooms
First, I guessed right that the breast augmentation surgery was done at an office-based plastic surgery center instead of a hospital.</description></item><item><title>Necrosis is a dangerous potential complication of plastic or cosmetic surgery, and there's limited time to address it</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/necrosis-is-a-dangerous-potential-complication-of-plastic-or-cosmetic-surgery-and-theres-limited-time-to-address-it/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/necrosis-is-a-dangerous-potential-complication-of-plastic-or-cosmetic-surgery-and-theres-limited-time-to-address-it/</guid><description>In my experience as a Houston, Texas medical malpractice lawyer, plastic and cosmetic surgery cases have some special considerations.
Unlike most other areas of medicine, the results of these elective procedures are often inherently subjective. In other words, the patient may have certain appearance-enhancing ideas in mind that the surgeon can claim, after the fact, were impossible, impractical, or certainly not the standard of care.
On the topic of the standard of care, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons is, in my view, notorious for refusing to even define standards of care applicable to plastic and cosmetic surgeons.</description></item><item><title>Breast implant revision/replacement has a higher risk than original breast augmentation surgery</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/breast-implant-revision/replacement-has-a-higher-risk-than-original-breast-augmentation-surgery/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/breast-implant-revision/replacement-has-a-higher-risk-than-original-breast-augmentation-surgery/</guid><description>Plastic and cosmetic surgeons use the term breast augmentation to describe the surgery that involves placing breast implants.
Breast augmentation isn&amp;rsquo;t considered permanent. In fact, most plastic surgeons and manufacturers recommend replacing breast implants every 8-10 years because of normal wear and tear, the possibility of leak or rupture, and contracture of scar tissue. Of course, many patients don&amp;rsquo;t have problems with their breast implants in the first 10 years and keep them in place for a longer period of time.</description></item><item><title>Cancer surgery is successful when there are clean margins, but when the surgeon stops short it can spell trouble</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/cancer-surgery-is-successful-when-there-are-clean-margins-but-when-the-surgeon-stops-short-it-can-spell-trouble/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/cancer-surgery-is-successful-when-there-are-clean-margins-but-when-the-surgeon-stops-short-it-can-spell-trouble/</guid><description>I attended an interesting deposition today in a pending medical malpractice wrongful death case.

Some risks, like damage to nearby structures, are unavoidable. Others, like medical malpractice, can be avoided with proper care.
Medically-indicated care versus unnecessary care
With these risks in mind, it&amp;rsquo;s critical for physicians and surgeons only to perform surgeries that are medical indicated and necessary. While the doctor stands to make money on these types of procedures, they pose an unnecessary risk to patients.</description></item><item><title>What happens when a plastic surgeon ignores or downplays infection symptoms after surgery?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-happens-when-a-plastic-surgeon-ignores-or-downplays-infection-symptoms-after-surgery/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-happens-when-a-plastic-surgeon-ignores-or-downplays-infection-symptoms-after-surgery/</guid><description>One of the known complications of any surgery, including a plastic or cosmetic procedure, is an infection.

Surgeons often describe the benefits of these procedures to include leaving fewer scars, being less invasive, having a faster recovery time, and reducing postoperative pain.
Laparoscopic techniques are recommended and preferred by most surgeons for a variety of surgeries including weight loss/bariatric procedures, gallbladder removal (cholecystectomy), abdominal hernia repairs, appendix removal (appendectomy), and even female sterilization.
From my experience as a Houston, Texas medical malpractice attorney, I believe that some surgeons leave out the risks when discussing these modern techniques.</description></item><item><title>Surgeons admit under oath to operating on wrong kidney</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surgeons-admit-under-oath-to-operating-on-wrong-kidney/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surgeons-admit-under-oath-to-operating-on-wrong-kidney/</guid><description>A few months ago, I wrote an article about a Tennessee surgeon who took a patient to surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and operated on the wrong kidney.

The idea behind cardiac clearance is to assess a patient&amp;rsquo;s risk of a cardiovascular event occurring during the surgery and what interventions and plans can be made to manage them.

The problem of patients developing infections or other injuries simply because of being treated in a hospital has become commonplace. It has become so widespread, in fact, that there is now a name for it: hospital-acquired injuries.
Hospital-acquired infections
In my practice as a Houston, Texas medical malpractice lawyer, one of the most common hospital-acquired injuries is infections. Sometimes a delay in diagnosing and treating these infections allows them to develop into deadly sepsis.</description></item><item><title>Many surgery centers are not prepared to handle operating room emergencies</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/many-surgery-centers-are-not-prepared-to-handle-operating-room-emergencies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/many-surgery-centers-are-not-prepared-to-handle-operating-room-emergencies/</guid><description>As a Houston, Texas medical malpractice lawyer, I have handled a lot of cases where the health care at issue was provided at a surgery center.

Why weight loss surgery is popular
I guess it should not be surprising that bariatric surgery has become rather popular. Statistics show that around 35% of U.S. adults are obese and over 67% are overweight or obese. To make matters worse, as we age, it is harder to lose and keep weight off because of a significant decrease in the number of calories we burn (called the basal metabolic rate).</description></item><item><title>For surgical nerve injuries, waiting for them to heal on their own can be dangerous</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/for-surgical-nerve-injuries-waiting-for-them-to-heal-on-their-own-can-be-dangerous/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/for-surgical-nerve-injuries-waiting-for-them-to-heal-on-their-own-can-be-dangerous/</guid><description>A patient recently called our office about a nerve injury that happened during a hernia repair surgery at a hospital in Houston&amp;#39;s Texas Medical Center.

Types of surgical site infections
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) describes three different types of surgical site infections.

Some complications occur despite quality care.
Other complications happen because a surgeon, doctor, or nurse is negligent or makes a mistake.

Most surgeons are in a race to see more and more patients every day in order to maintain their income level, which has taken a hit because of Medicare and insurance cuts. To that end, surgeons and their practice groups frequently hire mid-level providers to assist with the workload.</description></item><item><title>Watch out for these signs after a hernia repair</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/watch-out-for-these-signs-after-a-hernia-repair/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/watch-out-for-these-signs-after-a-hernia-repair/</guid><description>Most people who have experienced any type of abdominal hernia will tell you that it is one of the most painful things imaginable.
Generally speaking, a hernia is a medical condition where an organ pushes through an opening, or defect, in the muscle or tissue that is supposed to keep it in place. Common types of hernia include inguinal, incisional, femoral, umbilical, and hiatal hernias.

Some risks are avoidable and some are unavoidable.
One foreseeable complication is that the stress of surgery can trigger cardiac, or heart, complications, such as a heart attack (myocardial infarction), arrhythmia (an irregular heart rhythm), and acute coronary conditions.&amp;nbsp;
This is a particular concern considering the multiplication of surgical procedures being done on patients in their 50s, 60s, and older, where the risk of cardiac complications is higher.</description></item><item><title>The risks of liposuction</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-risks-of-liposuction/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-risks-of-liposuction/</guid><description>Liposuction is the most common cosmetic surgery in the world.
Some people think of it as a weight-loss tool, but most cosmetic surgeons use it for body contouring, by reducing fat deposits in specific localized areas, like parts of the abdomen, thighs, back, arms, calves, upper neck and lower face, chest, and buttocks.

Risks of DVTs with surgery
Any surgery or lengthy recovery period that requires bed rest increases the risk of developing deep vein thrombosis. Long periods of time without moving around promote clotting, and blood clots can form a DVT.

Most of these procedures are done for outpatient routine screening purposes in relatively healthy people. Some, though, are to investigate, and sometimes treat, bleeding and digestive issues.
Colonoscopies are procedures where a doctor inserts a flexible scope and camera through your rectum, to be able to inspect the inside of your colon.
In an EGD, also called an upper endoscopy, the doctor inserts the flexible scope and camera down your throat to be able to look inside your upper digestive track, including the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum.</description></item><item><title>How safe are surgical centers and doctor-owned hospitals?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-safe-are-surgical-centers-and-doctor-owned-hospitals/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-safe-are-surgical-centers-and-doctor-owned-hospitals/</guid><description>It is no secret that America&amp;rsquo;s healthcare system is in a constant financial crisis.
Despite the fact that health insurance premiums are skyrocketing, doctors complain that their share of the money has been getting smaller and smaller, while the lion&amp;rsquo;s share goes to hospitals and facilities. This has led many doctors to come up with ways to expand into that lucrative marketplace.

Even though every surgery carries certain risks, few people expect that they will be ones to experience a new illness, complication, or even death from the procedure.
