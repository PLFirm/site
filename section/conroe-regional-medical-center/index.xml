The case is pending in the 410th District Court of Montgomery County, Texas.
Raymond is an otherwise healthy middle-aged man who works for an oil service company. He was admitted to Conroe Regional Hospital because of injuries from a motorcycle accident. During an admission of over one month, he completely recovered from those injuries, but left the hospital with a pressure sore on the heel of his left foot.</description></item></channel></rss>
