In August 2012, this lady saw an OB/GYN because her monthly cycle had lasted for 14 days, and it was heavy and unusually painful. The OB/GYN prescribed Lysteda, a medication that prevents blood clots from breaking down, which the patient then filled at CVS Pharmacy, Inc.</description></item></channel></rss>
