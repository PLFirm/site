Let&amp;#39;s refer to her as Sarah.
Sarah was a delightful lady with a grandmotherly smile that brightened everyone&amp;#39;s day. Prior to hiring our firm, she underwent abdominal surgery and was scheduled for a short stay in a skilled nursing facility (SNF) to recover and regain strength before returning home. Despite some hearing difficulties, Sarah led an independent life and was generally healthy.</description></item><item><title>Data show a big difference between hospital and office anesthesia safety</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/data-show-a-big-difference-between-hospital-and-office-anesthesia-safety/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/data-show-a-big-difference-between-hospital-and-office-anesthesia-safety/</guid><description>Today&amp;#39;s healthcare consumers have more choices than ever before. When it comes to surgeries and procedures, patients have the option of having them done in an office setting or a hospital operating room. Patients also have the option of selecting a physician anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist to provide anesthesia care, although many facilities do not present it as a choice.
Why have a procedure in an office instead of a hospital operating room?</description></item><item><title>Houston hospital discharges man with post-operative internal bleeding</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/houston-hospital-discharges-man-with-post-operative-internal-bleeding/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/houston-hospital-discharges-man-with-post-operative-internal-bleeding/</guid><description>A middle-aged man was visiting Houston, Texas for work when he suddenly had severe abdominal pain. Let&amp;rsquo;s call him Leonard.
After the pain, nausea, and vomiting didn&amp;rsquo;t go away for two days, Leonard went to a local hospital emergency room (ER) to get checked out. The ER physician ordered an abdominal CT scan, which showed that Leonard had acute appendicitis, which fortunately had not perforated or formed an abscess.
Leonard was admitted to the hospital and seen by a general surgeon the same day, who decided to take him to the operating room to perform a laparoscopic appendectomy.</description></item><item><title>Complications that pay out up to $10 million in bariatric weight loss surgeries</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/complications-that-pay-out-up-to-10-million-in-bariatric-weight-loss-surgeries/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/complications-that-pay-out-up-to-10-million-in-bariatric-weight-loss-surgeries/</guid><description>In 2022, the American Society of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery released its first-ever report from its closed-claim (insurance payout) registry. The two most shocking findings to me are:
&amp;bull; Death was the most common outcome that led to medical malpractice lawsuits (27.1% of all claims).
&amp;bull; Monetary awards of all types of complications topped out at $10,400,000.
Common complications from Bariatric Weight Loss Surgeries
The study found that death was the number 1 complication leading to a bariatric weight loss surgery medical malpractice lawsuit.</description></item><item><title>Obstetrician, hospitalist, other physicians fail to diagnose damaged ureter, internal urine leak after hysterectomy</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/obstetrician-hospitalist-other-physicians-fail-to-diagnose-damaged-ureter-internal-urine-leak-after-hysterectomy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/obstetrician-hospitalist-other-physicians-fail-to-diagnose-damaged-ureter-internal-urine-leak-after-hysterectomy/</guid><description>One of the most common defenses used in surgical medical malpractice cases is that a complication is a known risk of the procedure. Known risks are things that can happen even when care is appropriate and no negligence was involved. Theyâ€™re usually detailed in the informed consent paperwork that patients are asked to sign before care begins.
For example, when a patient has a hysterectomy, itâ€™s a known risk that the ureter can be damaged, resulting in a leak of urine into the patientâ€™s peritoneal cavity.</description></item><item><title>Adhesions increase the risk of abdominal or pelvic surgery</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/adhesions-increase-the-risk-of-abdominal-or-pelvic-surgery/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/adhesions-increase-the-risk-of-abdominal-or-pelvic-surgery/</guid><description>Our firm has handled several Texas medical malpractice cases where patients had abdominal or pelvic surgery that went amuck because of a surgeonâ€™s poor handling of adhesions.
Adhesions are connective tissue formations that connect structures that are normally separate and unconnected. They can form because of trauma to the abdomen and pelvis, but more frequently form in the natural process of healing after surgery. Different medical studies have reported the presence of adhesions in between 20â€“93% of surgical patients.</description></item><item><title>Post-operative infections, sepsis can trigger a stroke</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/post-operative-infections-sepsis-can-trigger-a-stroke/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/post-operative-infections-sepsis-can-trigger-a-stroke/</guid><description>A woman in her 50s went to a hospital to have a bariatric conversion procedure.&amp;nbsp;
Over a decade earlier, she had a lap band procedure, but had recently started having problems with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. After consulting with her bariatric surgeon, she decided to have her lap band removed and convert over to a gastric bypass.
Unfortunately, during the conversion surgery, the surgeon perforated part of her bowel and didnâ€™t recognize it.</description></item><item><title>See what the El Paso Court of Appeals has to say about an OB/GYN surgeon not doing a surgery he charged for, leaving the patient in the dark</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/see-what-the-el-paso-court-of-appeals-has-to-say-about-an-ob/gyn-surgeon-not-doing-a-surgery-he-charged-for-leaving-the-patient-in-the-dark/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/see-what-the-el-paso-court-of-appeals-has-to-say-about-an-ob/gyn-surgeon-not-doing-a-surgery-he-charged-for-leaving-the-patient-in-the-dark/</guid><description>The El Paso Court of Appeals recently issued an interesting opinion in a summary judgment case arising from allegations that an OB/GYN physician failed to perform a surgery for which he billed the collected money from the patient.

What are the basics of laparoscopic surgery?
Unlike conventional open-approach abdominal surgeries that require one or more large incisions, the hallmark of laparoscopic surgery is small incisions. The small incisions are why laparoscopic surgeries are often described as being minimally invasive.
In all abdominal laparoscopic procedures, there is a primary incision of around one-half an inch near the belly button.</description></item><item><title>Outpatient surgery centers are different from hospital operating rooms</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/outpatient-surgery-centers-are-different-from-hospital-operating-rooms/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/outpatient-surgery-centers-are-different-from-hospital-operating-rooms/</guid><description>Ambulatory surgery centers are increasingly popular alternatives to hospital-based outpatient surgeries. Most surgeries, by the way, are outpatient surgeries, rather than requiring a hospital admission.
According to the Texas Ambulatory Surgery Center Society, the first surgery center in the United States opened in 1970. There are over 5,300 ambulatory surgery centers today nationwide, and 430 in Texas alone. In some states, there are more surgery centers than hospitals. A majority of all outpatient surgeries in America are now performed in an ambulatory surgery center.</description></item><item><title>Houston dermatologist and his so-called cosmetic surgery center lose medical malpractice appeal</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/houston-dermatologist-and-his-so-called-cosmetic-surgery-center-lose-medical-malpractice-appeal/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/houston-dermatologist-and-his-so-called-cosmetic-surgery-center-lose-medical-malpractice-appeal/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m spending the day in depositions in a pending cosmetic surgery malpractice case in the Dallas Fort Worth (DFW) area. In that case, the cosmetic surgeon was an obstetrician, not a plastic surgeon, and left the patient with permanent disfigurement and other injuries.
In this context, it seems fitting to discuss a recent opinion entered by Houston&amp;rsquo;s First Court of Appeals involving alleged cosmetic surgery malpractice where the provider was a dermatologist, rather than a surgeon.</description></item><item><title>What happens in the operating room after a patient is put to sleep?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-happens-in-the-operating-room-after-a-patient-is-put-to-sleep/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-happens-in-the-operating-room-after-a-patient-is-put-to-sleep/</guid><description>Although virtually any type of healthcare involves some level of patient risks, there are some unique ones when it comes to care in the operating room (OR). One challenge is that when patients are placed under general anesthesia, they have no idea what&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp; happened in their care until they wake up, usually in the recovery room.
For instance, patients might think they know the answers to these questions before being wheeled off to the OR, but could be wrong:</description></item><item><title>Retained surgical sponges and medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/retained-surgical-sponges-and-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/retained-surgical-sponges-and-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>In any field or occupation, I bet there are common themes that experienced professionals see every day. From mechanics to plumbers, from teachers to preachers, the thought &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen this 100 times&amp;rdquo; has to run through their mind.
Some medical malpractice claims are no different. For instance, there&amp;rsquo;s a common theme that I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed in cases involving unintentionally retained surgical items, specifically sponges.
When a foreign object is left inside a patient, it essentially becomes a magnet for infection and can wreak havoc across the entire body.</description></item><item><title>Esophageal perforation management and medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/esophageal-perforation-management-and-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/esophageal-perforation-management-and-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>Esophageal perforation is a dreaded rare complication of surgeries and procedures involving the neck.
What is the esophagus?
The esophagus is a muscular tube for the transport of food and liquids from the throat to the gastrointestinal tract. It&amp;rsquo;s located anterior (in front of) the spinal column and posterior (behind) the trachea, or windpipe.
How can the esophagus get perforated in the operating room?
Medical studies report that esophageal perforation has occurred in procedures including anterior cervical spine surgery, endoscopy (placement of a flexible scope with camera down the throat), and during intubation or extubation (placing or removing, respectively, an endotracheal tube down the throat for general anesthesia).</description></item><item><title>Closed claims show common bariatric/weight loss surgery medical malpractice trends</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/closed-claims-show-common-bariatric/weight-loss-surgery-medical-malpractice-trends/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/closed-claims-show-common-bariatric/weight-loss-surgery-medical-malpractice-trends/</guid><description>A closed claims study identified the most common themes in bariatric medical malpractice cases.
Studies like this remind me of the old saying about how experience teaches.
In health care, experience is certainly important. This includes learning from mistakes. That&amp;rsquo;s why when there are certain bad outcomes&amp;mdash;sentinel events&amp;mdash;accreditation standards and the standard of care require a root cause analysis. The idea is to figure out why health care mistakes happen and to incorporate training to prevent them from being repeated.</description></item><item><title>Wrong patient taken to kidney transplant surgery</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/wrong-patient-taken-to-kidney-transplant-surgery/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/wrong-patient-taken-to-kidney-transplant-surgery/</guid><description>Although in my practice as a Texas medical malpractice attorney, I regularly encounter wrong-site, wrong-patient surgical cases, every now and then something comes up that is just astounding.

The most common problem that we hear about from potential clients calling Painter Law Firm is the unintended injury of the nearby organ during surgery. The most common of these iatrogenic (healthcare-acquired) injuries are lacerated or torn bowel, stomach, liver, or spleen. These injuries are more difficult to spot during surgery because the surgeon is working with equipment and a camera inserted through small incisions in the abdomen.</description></item><item><title>The dangers of oversedation for pain management, other office surgical procedures</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-dangers-of-oversedation-for-pain-management-other-office-surgical-procedures/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-dangers-of-oversedation-for-pain-management-other-office-surgical-procedures/</guid><description>Recent medical research and malpractice claims history have shown that unnecessary use of sedation and oversedation have become serious problems for the safety of surgical patients.
The most common factors leading to severe anoxic/hypoxic brain injuries or death include:
&amp;bull; Failure to follow the standard of care, as evidenced by peer-reviewed recommendations and guidelines
&amp;bull; The use of deep sedation when it&amp;rsquo;s not necessary

Physical therapists tout the very real benefits of post-operative physical therapy, including:
&amp;bull; Restoring or improving mobility and flexibility
&amp;bull; Helping with balance
&amp;bull; Building strength
&amp;bull; Reducing swelling and pain
&amp;bull; Reducing formation of scar tissue with tissue mobilization techniques
In some situations, though, physical therapists can become overly aggressive in rushing to start physical therapy too early, before it&amp;rsquo;s safe for the patient to do so.</description></item><item><title>Operating room fires make the top 10 list of 2020 hospital sentinel/never events</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/operating-room-fires-make-the-top-10-list-of-2020-hospital-sentinel/never-events/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/operating-room-fires-make-the-top-10-list-of-2020-hospital-sentinel/never-events/</guid><description>When The Joint Commission, a healthcare accrediting agency, recently released its report on 2020 hospital and healthcare facility sentinel events (also called never events because they&amp;rsquo;re never supposed to occur, but somehow still do), fire was among on the list of the 10 most common ones.
I bet most people thing of a building up in flames when the word fire comes to mind.

As a former hospital administrator, I know that sentinel events (also called never events) are a big deal. Accrediting agencies require hospital leaders to investigate sentinel events using a process called a root cause analysis. The idea is that this deep dive will identify what led to the serious health care error and what changes to policies, procedures, and education can prevent it from injuring other patients in the future.</description></item><item><title>2021 National Patient Safety Goals revisit familiar areas</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/2021-national-patient-safety-goals-revisit-familiar-areas/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/2021-national-patient-safety-goals-revisit-familiar-areas/</guid><description>The Joint Commission&amp;mdash;the oldest and best known healthcare accrediting agency in America&amp;mdash;recently announced its 2021 National Patient Safety Goals.
As a former hospital administrator, I know that National Patient Safety Goals get the attention and careful study of hospital leaders. These goals set the standard of care in hospitals nationwide by requiring hospitals to meet objectives in order to attain or maintain accreditation. And, of course, accreditation is necessary for facilities to receive Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance payments.</description></item><item><title>Ambulatory surgery centers struggle to balance profits with patient safety</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/ambulatory-surgery-centers-struggle-to-balance-profits-with-patient-safety/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/ambulatory-surgery-centers-struggle-to-balance-profits-with-patient-safety/</guid><description>Hospital Review hosted an Orthopedics + Ambulatory Surgery Center (ASC) Virtual Forum this week, which had some interesting take-aways on the significant changes in how orthopedic surgeries are performed.

Beyond these concerns, though, the most common type of sleep apnea, called obstructive sleep apnea, is a serious and potentially life-threatening medical condition.
Obstructive sleep apnea is a medical condition where the muscles of the throat and soft palate intermittently relax during sleep. When this happens, those anatomical structures drop and partially or fully obstruct the airway.</description></item><item><title>When does the willful and wanton standard of proof apply in Texas ER medical malpractice cases?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/when-does-the-willful-and-wanton-standard-of-proof-apply-in-texas-er-medical-malpractice-cases/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/when-does-the-willful-and-wanton-standard-of-proof-apply-in-texas-er-medical-malpractice-cases/</guid><description>Texas law treats medical malpractice lawsuits differently from other types of negligence cases. One of the significant differences is a heightened standard of proof in some types of claims.
Texas Civil Practice &amp;amp; Remedies Code Section 74.153 mandates a standard of proof called “willful and wanton negligence” for certain emergency medical care cases. If you’re confused by what that means, join the club.

I like the way Dallas TV station WFAA phrased it in their reporting on this issue.</description></item><item><title>FDA cautions that robotic surgery is unproven and potentially dangerous for cancer surgeries</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/fda-cautions-that-robotic-surgery-is-unproven-and-potentially-dangerous-for-cancer-surgeries/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/fda-cautions-that-robotic-surgery-is-unproven-and-potentially-dangerous-for-cancer-surgeries/</guid><description>The men and women in suits who run hospitals love to advertise when their facilities offer robotic surgery.

It&amp;rsquo;s understandable that they want to recover the significant investment required to purchase robotic surgical equipment. Yet, a growing body of research shows that claims about the superiority of robotic surgery aren&amp;rsquo;t backed up by any evidence.</description></item><item><title>Registered nurse (RN) roles, duties, and medical malpractice in Texas</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/registered-nurse-rn-roles-duties-and-medical-malpractice-in-texas/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/registered-nurse-rn-roles-duties-and-medical-malpractice-in-texas/</guid><description>Last week, I was at the Harris County Civil Courthouse twice for oral hearings that focused, in part, on the role of nursing care in medical malpractice cases.

Ambulatory surgery centers are outpatient facilities that were originally designed to allow surgeons to benefit financially from the lucrative facility fee charges that would otherwise go to hospitals.

For example, in one case, a College Station woman went to the emergency room because of sudden, severe abdominal pain.

She was taken to the operating room for a laparoscopic appendectomy and then discharged on the same day.</description></item><item><title>Are outpatient ambulatory surgery centers as safe as hospitals?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/are-outpatient-ambulatory-surgery-centers-as-safe-as-hospitals/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/are-outpatient-ambulatory-surgery-centers-as-safe-as-hospitals/</guid><description>From my experience as a Houston, Texas medical malpractice attorney, I cast a wary eye at outpatient or ambulatory surgery centers.

I guess it should not be surprising that bariatric surgery has become rather popular. Statistics show that around 35% of U.S. adults are obese and over 67% are overweight or obese.

Quite often, it seemed to them that something was wrong after the operation, but the surgeon convinced them just to give it time and things would get better on their own.
As a result, they did not get a second opinion or treatment fast enough to prevent permanent, life-changing problems caused by a botched surgery.</description></item><item><title>Gastroparesis: What causes stomach paralysis and how to treat it</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/gastroparesis-what-causes-stomach-paralysis-and-how-to-treat-it/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/gastroparesis-what-causes-stomach-paralysis-and-how-to-treat-it/</guid><description>As bariatric weight loss surgery has become more popular, I have noticed more and more patients calling my office about serious, life-changing problems after a botched surgery. One of the medical problems that a number of my clients are experiencing is gastroparesis.
A normally-functioning stomach has a major role in digesting food, as well as emptying the contents into the small intestines for further digestion.
With gastroparesis, the stomach is partially paralyzed.</description></item><item><title>How to assess your risk of potentially deadly blood clots and DVTs during surgery</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-to-assess-your-risk-of-potentially-deadly-blood-clots-and-dvts-during-surgery/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-to-assess-your-risk-of-potentially-deadly-blood-clots-and-dvts-during-surgery/</guid><description>When facing practically any surgery, one of the major risks that is often not talked about is blood clots.
When a patient is under general anesthesia and immobile for a long time on the operating table, there is dramatically increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). This is a condition caused by blood pooling in the deep veins of the legs, which creates an ideal environment for clots to form.</description></item><item><title>Botched spinal surgery or injection can cause painful, disabling arachnoiditis</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/botched-spinal-surgery-or-injection-can-cause-painful-disabling-arachnoiditis/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/botched-spinal-surgery-or-injection-can-cause-painful-disabling-arachnoiditis/</guid><description>As a Texas medical malpractice lawyer, new clients frequently call about neurological problems with their brain or spinal cord.

Other complications happen because a surgeon, doctor, or nurse is negligent or makes a mistake.

Most surgeons are in a race to see more and more patients every day in order to maintain their income level, which has taken a hit because of Medicare and insurance cuts. To that end, surgeons and their practice groups frequently hire mid-level providers to assist with the workload.</description></item><item><title>Watch out for these signs after a hernia repair</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/watch-out-for-these-signs-after-a-hernia-repair/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/watch-out-for-these-signs-after-a-hernia-repair/</guid><description>Most people who have experienced any type of abdominal hernia will tell you that it is one of the most painful things imaginable.
Generally speaking, a hernia is a medical condition where an organ pushes through an opening, or defect, in the muscle or tissue that is supposed to keep it in place. Common types of hernia include inguinal, incisional, femoral, umbilical, and hiatal hernias.

Weight loss surgery malpractice
In my experience, most bariatric malpractice cases involve gastric outlet obstruction, a condition that is often caused by a surgical error that makes it difficult or impossible for food to pass through the esophagus and stomach, into the intestines.</description></item><item><title>The importance of pre-surgery cardiac clearance</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-importance-of-pre-surgery-cardiac-clearance/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-importance-of-pre-surgery-cardiac-clearance/</guid><description>Any time a patient is taken to surgery, there are risks involved. Some risks are avoidable and some are unavoidable.
One foreseeable complication is that the stress of surgery can trigger cardiac, or heart, complications, such as a heart attack (myocardial infarction), arrhythmia (an irregular heart rhythm), and acute coronary conditions.&amp;nbsp;
This is a particular concern considering the multiplication of surgical procedures being done on patients in their 50s, 60s, and older, where the risk of cardiac complications is higher.</description></item><item><title>The risks of liposuction</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-risks-of-liposuction/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-risks-of-liposuction/</guid><description>Liposuction is the most common cosmetic surgery in the world.
Some people think of it as a weight-loss tool, but most cosmetic surgeons use it for body contouring, by reducing fat deposits in specific localized areas, like parts of the abdomen, thighs, back, arms, calves, upper neck and lower face, chest, and buttocks.
From my experience as a Texas medical malpractice lawyer, I believe that many people are unaware of the serious risks of liposuction.</description></item><item><title>A long surgery has a high risk of DVT blood clots forming</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/a-long-surgery-has-a-high-risk-of-dvt-blood-clots-forming/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/a-long-surgery-has-a-high-risk-of-dvt-blood-clots-forming/</guid><description>The longer you are in surgery, the more your risk goes up for developing dangerous blood clots in the deep veins of your legs, called a deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
Risks of DVTs with surgery
Any surgery or lengthy recovery period that requires bed rest increases the risk of developing deep vein thrombosis. Long periods of time without moving around promote clotting, and blood clots can form a DVT.
The longer an operation, the greater the risk of forming a DVT.</description></item><item><title>Surprising risks of deep sedation anesthesia during upper endoscopy and colonoscopy procedures</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surprising-risks-of-deep-sedation-anesthesia-during-upper-endoscopy-and-colonoscopy-procedures/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surprising-risks-of-deep-sedation-anesthesia-during-upper-endoscopy-and-colonoscopy-procedures/</guid><description>Each year in the United States, doctors perform around 14 million colonoscopies and seven million esophagogastroduodenoscopies (EGDs).
Most of these procedures are done for outpatient routine screening purposes in relatively healthy people. Some, though, are to investigate, and sometimes treat, bleeding and digestive issues.
Colonoscopies are procedures where a doctor inserts a flexible scope and camera through your rectum, to be able to inspect the inside of your colon.
In an EGD, also called an upper endoscopy, the doctor inserts the flexible scope and camera down your throat to be able to look inside your upper digestive track, including the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum.</description></item><item><title>How safe are surgical centers and doctor-owned hospitals?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-safe-are-surgical-centers-and-doctor-owned-hospitals/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-safe-are-surgical-centers-and-doctor-owned-hospitals/</guid><description>It is no secret that America&amp;rsquo;s healthcare system is in a constant financial crisis.
Despite the fact that health insurance premiums are skyrocketing, doctors complain that their share of the money has been getting smaller and smaller, while the lion&amp;rsquo;s share goes to hospitals and facilities. This has led many doctors to come up with ways to expand into that lucrative marketplace.
Let me explain.
In Texas, we have a strange legal doctrine called the Corporate Practice of Medicine Act, which basically means that doctors cannot be hospital employees.</description></item><item><title>Surgical checklists increase patient safety</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surgical-checklists-increase-patient-safety/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surgical-checklists-increase-patient-safety/</guid><description>When people consent to have a surgery, they do so because it will likely fix a problem or sickness that they are experiencing.
Even though every surgery carries certain risks, few people expect that they will be ones to experience a new illness, complication, or even death from the procedure.
