In routine labor and delivery situations, midwife care can be great. As a medical malpractice attorney representing families across Texas, though, I’ve seen firsthand how midwife-assisted births can have devastating consequences when things go wrong. This comprehensive guide will help you understand the legal framework governing midwifery in Texas, with special attention to morbidity rates and safety requirements.</description></item><item><title>How to prove a DVT/pulmonary embolism medical malpractice case in Texas</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-to-prove-a-dvt/pulmonary-embolism-medical-malpractice-case-in-texas/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-to-prove-a-dvt/pulmonary-embolism-medical-malpractice-case-in-texas/</guid><description>Pulmonary embolism is a dangerous condition that starts with the formation of a blood clot, usually in the deep veins of the legs (DVT and pulmonary embolism diagnosis, treatment, and medical malpractice). When a clot breaks loose, travels, and blocks an artery supplying the lung, it is called a pulmonary embolism. When a pulmonary embolism is not diagnosed and treated properly, the mortality rate is around 30 percent. When promptly treated, the death rate is less than 10 percent.</description></item><item><title>How Texas medical malpractice plaintiffs are paid for future medical expenses after winning at trial</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-texas-medical-malpractice-plaintiffs-are-paid-for-future-medical-expenses-after-winning-at-trial/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-texas-medical-malpractice-plaintiffs-are-paid-for-future-medical-expenses-after-winning-at-trial/</guid><description>The Texas Supreme Court recently released a long-awaited opinion that addresses practical issues for the periodic payment statute that applies to any jury award of future medical expenses. The case is styled Virlar v. Puente; No. 20-092, and you can read the opinion here.
The big picture on future medical expenses
In catastrophic medical malpractice cases, the largest element of damages is typically future medical expenses. When a patient develops a brain injury because of health care negligence, for example, he or she can require around-the-clock care that can cost millions of dollars over the patient&amp;rsquo;s life expectancy.</description></item><item><title>Understanding how damages caps work in Texas medical malpractice cases</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/understanding-how-damages-caps-work-in-texas-medical-malpractice-cases/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/understanding-how-damages-caps-work-in-texas-medical-malpractice-cases/</guid><description>Damages caps are probably the part of Texas medical malpractice tort reform law that get more attention than any other. Yet, it still generates a lot of confusion and is worth discussing.
Not all damages are capped
The term damages refers to the categories of compensation that a plaintiff can seek at trial.
The most important thing to understand about damages caps in Texas medical malpractice cases is that not everything is capped.</description></item><item><title>FAQ: When does a medical mistake amount to medical malpractice in Texas?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/faq-when-does-a-medical-mistake-amount-to-medical-malpractice-in-texas/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/faq-when-does-a-medical-mistake-amount-to-medical-malpractice-in-texas/</guid><description>One of the most common questions we hear from potential clients at Painter Law Firm is whether a bad outcome amounts to medical malpractice or is legally actionable.
While news of a poor result or complication isn&amp;rsquo;t welcomed by anyone, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean that a hospital, physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or registered nurse did anything wrong. On the other hand, just because the informed consent paperwork lists things that could potentially go wrong with a treatment or surgery doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that a bad outcome isn&amp;rsquo;t medical malpractice.</description></item><item><title>Why lawyers can't accept your case to sue a hospital or doctor</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/why-lawyers-cant-accept-your-case-to-sue-a-hospital-or-doctor/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/why-lawyers-cant-accept-your-case-to-sue-a-hospital-or-doctor/</guid><description>As a former hospital administrator, I have a keen interest in promoting and seeing patient safety improvement. In fact, that&amp;rsquo;s a major reason why I became a medical malpractice attorney. I believe the accountability and financial incentives generated by the civil justice system are often what are necessary to see real positive change in health care.
Of course, tort reform lobbyists don&amp;rsquo;t see things that way. They describe attorneys who help seriously injured people as &amp;ldquo;ambulance chasers&amp;rdquo; and run advertisements touting this online and throughout the media.</description></item><item><title>Why almost dying or almost having a serious injury isn't enough for a medical malpractice claim</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/why-almost-dying-or-almost-having-a-serious-injury-isnt-enough-for-a-medical-malpractice-claim/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/why-almost-dying-or-almost-having-a-serious-injury-isnt-enough-for-a-medical-malpractice-claim/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s a scary thing to almost die.
Here at Painter Law Firm, we speak with multiple people each week who&amp;rsquo;ve had this experience, either with themselves or a family member.
Under Texas law, though, almost dying or almost having a serious injury isn&amp;rsquo;t enough to justify a medical malpractice case.
Medical malpractice is a form of negligence.
Most people focus on the first element of negligence claims&amp;mdash;the mistake. More precisely, negligence causes of action require a plaintiff to show that a person violated a duty owed to another person.</description></item><item><title>Who can issue a subpoena in Texas?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/who-can-issue-a-subpoena-in-texas/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/who-can-issue-a-subpoena-in-texas/</guid><description>Subpoenas, particularly of non-parties, come up in some way in virtually every Texas medical malpractice lawsuit.
Under Texas law, an attorney may independently issue a subpoena in a pending lawsuit. In other words, a discovery or trial subpoena doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be issued directly by a judge.
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 176 defines the requirements for a valid subpoena, including the subpoena must:

I recently presented a client for deposition in a tragic birth injury case. Based on delays in delivery, her child developed a permanent birth-related brain injury and cerebral palsy. When a defense attorney asked how she picked her obstetrician (OB/GYN physician), she testified that she looked online for someone near her house and then checked Google reviews.</description></item><item><title>Why are medical experts for a medical malpractice case often from out of state?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/why-are-medical-experts-for-a-medical-malpractice-case-often-from-out-of-state/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/why-are-medical-experts-for-a-medical-malpractice-case-often-from-out-of-state/</guid><description>Here at Painter Law Firm, well-meaning, sincere potential clients contact us to seek help and mention that they already have a doctor lined up to support their potential case.
For example, I once represented an attorney client in a case where he felt 100% certain that his treating physician would offer helpful testimony. Even though this doctor wasn&amp;rsquo;t a party to the lawsuit, I was highly skeptical. I told my client not to hold his breath.</description></item><item><title>What to do when you think your medical records are inaccurate</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-to-do-when-you-think-your-medical-records-are-inaccurate/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-to-do-when-you-think-your-medical-records-are-inaccurate/</guid><description>We often get questions from clients and potential clients concerning medical records that are inconsistent with their recollection of the care that was provided or physician or nursing statements at that time.
Sometimes people wonder if someone else&amp;rsquo;s medical record, lab results, or radiology report may have gotten mixed in their file. Other times, patients wonder if a doctor, nurse, or administrative staff member went back and removed or modified medical records.</description></item><item><title>Why are tax returns relevant in a Texas medical malpractice case?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/why-are-tax-returns-relevant-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-case/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/why-are-tax-returns-relevant-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-case/</guid><description>For many people who are seriously injured because of medical mistakes and errors in Texas, the pain, suffering, mental anguish, and permanents impairments are the worst elements to deal with. These harms and losses are called noneconomic damages and, under Texas law, they&amp;rsquo;re subject to tort reform caps. The caps range from $250,000&amp;ndash;$750,000, depending on the number and type of defendants sued.
Unlike noneconomic damages, past and future lost wages or loss of earning capacity aren&amp;rsquo;t capped.</description></item><item><title>Why is an attorney-client fee agreement important in a Texas medical malpractice case?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/why-is-an-attorney-client-fee-agreement-important-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-case/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/why-is-an-attorney-client-fee-agreement-important-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-case/</guid><description>Medical malpractice cases are typically complex, costly, and time consuming. Legal requirements for medical expert witnesses mean that most cases will cost tens of thousands of dollars or more to prepare for trial.
Because clients generally don&amp;rsquo;t have the funds available to cover these expenses, most experienced medical malpractice lawyers handle cases under a contingency fee arrangement. Under this arrangement, the plaintiff&amp;rsquo;s attorney normally charges a fee of 40% of any recovery.</description></item><item><title>Can you file a Texas medical malpractice case in federal court?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/can-you-file-a-texas-medical-malpractice-case-in-federal-court/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/can-you-file-a-texas-medical-malpractice-case-in-federal-court/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s unusual for medical malpractice cases to be filed in state court because they&amp;rsquo;re a type of negligence claim that arises under state law. But it&amp;rsquo;s not impossible to end up if the circumstances are right.
Diversity jurisdiction of federal district courts is defined by 28 U.S. Code Section 1332, which grants original jurisdiction where:
&amp;bull; The amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. Virtually any medical negligence case will pass that threshold.</description></item><item><title>Is it a good idea to keep a journal or take notes during a hospital stay?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/is-it-a-good-idea-to-keep-a-journal-or-take-notes-during-a-hospital-stay/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/is-it-a-good-idea-to-keep-a-journal-or-take-notes-during-a-hospital-stay/</guid><description>Is it a good idea to keep a journal or take notes during a hospital stay?
&amp;nbsp;
One of the first things that we ask new Texas medical malpractice clients is whether they took any notes during the hospitalization or care in question. Our team at Painter Law Firm finds them to be a useful source of evidence to fill in gaps in the medical records or to rebut documentation that&amp;rsquo;s just flat out wrong.</description></item><item><title>What happens if a Texas medical malpractice case doesnâ€™t settle at mediation?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-happens-if-a-texas-medical-malpractice-case-doesn%C3%A2t-settle-at-mediation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-happens-if-a-texas-medical-malpractice-case-doesn%C3%A2t-settle-at-mediation/</guid><description>Mediation is a popular form of alternative dispute resolution (ADR). Most Texas medical malpractice cases are mediated before going to trial.
Mediators aren&amp;rsquo;t judges (even though some of them are former or retired judges). Mediators can&amp;rsquo;t force defendants to offer more money than they want to, or force plaintiffs to accept a settlement offer&amp;mdash;even when the mediator thinks it&amp;rsquo;s a good one.
The role of the mediator is to facilitate settlement negotiations between plaintiffs and defendants.</description></item><item><title>How does death affect a Texas medical malpractice case?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-does-death-affect-a-texas-medical-malpractice-case/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-does-death-affect-a-texas-medical-malpractice-case/</guid><description>There are several issues that come to play in the unfortunate event when a plaintiff or potential plaintiff in a medical malpractice case dies.
Death because of medical negligence
If a patient dies because of medical mistakes, it will be a medical malpractice wrongful death lawsuit. Under Texas law, these claims are subject to the health care tort reform overall cap of approximately $2.1 million.
For wrongful death medical malpractice cases, there are two important things to remember:</description></item><item><title>Why is it hard to sue Texas public hospitals for medical malpractice?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/why-is-it-hard-to-sue-texas-public-hospitals-for-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/why-is-it-hard-to-sue-texas-public-hospitals-for-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>There are three main reasons why it&amp;rsquo;s difficult, and sometimes impossible, to hold a Texas public hospital accountable for medical negligence. All three are related to the Texas Tort Claims Act.
&amp;bull; Many people miss the notice requirement. While the general statute of limitations for medical malpractice claims is two years, plaintiffs must provide public hospitals with a notice of claim letter within six months (for state hospitals) or even less (for county or city hospitals), or the claim may be barred.</description></item><item><title>Mediation and attorney's fees in Texas medical malpractice cases</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/mediation-and-attorneys-fees-in-texas-medical-malpractice-cases/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/mediation-and-attorneys-fees-in-texas-medical-malpractice-cases/</guid><description>Mediation is a time set aside when the parties to a claim or lawsuit get together to try to resolve the matter without having to go to trial. The mediator is a neutral person, usually an attorney, retired judge, or insurance company adjuster, who facilitate settlement discussions.
Unlike arbitration or trial, the mediator can&amp;rsquo;t impose a decision on the parties. It&amp;rsquo;s up to both sides show up with authority to negotiate in good faith and, if possible, settle the claim.</description></item><item><title>What can I do to prove medical malpractice when my medical records are false?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-can-i-do-to-prove-medical-malpractice-when-my-medical-records-are-false/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-can-i-do-to-prove-medical-malpractice-when-my-medical-records-are-false/</guid><description>One of the most frustrating things for patients and family members who&amp;rsquo;ve been harmed by medical malpractice is to read medical records that have big gaps or blatantly false information. We often get the question of, &amp;ldquo;What can we do to prove our case?&amp;rdquo;
To start, in any Texas medical malpractice case, the law requires the plaintiff to have the support of one or more medical experts. Medical experts have to define in writing the applicable standard care, how the doctor, nurse, or hospital violated the standard care, and how that conduct caused harm.</description></item><item><title>Can I record a conversation in Texas with a doctor or someone from hospital administration?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/can-i-record-a-conversation-in-texas-with-a-doctor-or-someone-from-hospital-administration/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/can-i-record-a-conversation-in-texas-with-a-doctor-or-someone-from-hospital-administration/</guid><description>This is a question that comes up pretty frequently. The follow-up to the question is whether you can record the conversation without telling the physician, nurse, or hospital administrator.
Some people like to record complicated, hard-to-comprehend medical conversations so they can listen to them later and get help to understand them. Other people record conversations as potential evidence when there was poor care or a bad healthcare outcome.
Before getting into how Texas treats the subject, it&amp;rsquo;s important to realize that the laws on this sometimes-controversial subject vary from state to state</description></item><item><title>How does a workersâ€™ compensation lien work in a medical malpractice case?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-does-a-workers%C3%A2-compensation-lien-work-in-a-medical-malpractice-case/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-does-a-workers%C3%A2-compensation-lien-work-in-a-medical-malpractice-case/</guid><description>Texas law is extreme when it comes to handling medical malpractice lawsuit settlements where any insurance company has paid out any funds related to the claim. As you might expect in our current tort reform environment, the law is overly-generous to workers&amp;rsquo; compensation carriers who can show up after a recovery to demand a cut.
Overall, workers&amp;rsquo; compensation is a good insurance benefit for employees. It&amp;rsquo;s a strict liability system where a subscribing employee&amp;rsquo;s insurance company is on the hook for unlimited medical expenses and certain wage benefits for an employee&amp;rsquo;s compensable injuries that occurred in the course and scope of employment.</description></item><item><title>Can I pursue a Texas medical malpractice case if my medical records are inaccurate?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/can-i-pursue-a-texas-medical-malpractice-case-if-my-medical-records-are-inaccurate/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/can-i-pursue-a-texas-medical-malpractice-case-if-my-medical-records-are-inaccurate/</guid><description>When we meet with a new medical malpractice client at Painter Law Firm, we do a thorough interview to make sure we understand exactly what happened during the relevant healthcare that led to serious injury.
The next step is ordering all of the relevant medical records for a careful review.

Many people are glued to their phones and devices, with much of the time spent on social media. While a lot of what&amp;rsquo;s posted online may be insignificant, during litigation, there&amp;rsquo;s a growing interest&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;probing into social media posts related to the underlying facts that led to a lawsuit and the lawsuit itself.
In some cases, the legal arguments over requiring a party to produce social media data can be intense.</description></item><item><title>Can supplements or medications injure a baby during pregnancy?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/can-supplements-or-medications-injure-a-baby-during-pregnancy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/can-supplements-or-medications-injure-a-baby-during-pregnancy/</guid><description>Pregnancy is a wonderful time of life for parents. Seeking early prenatal care with an OB/GYN physician is important to keep the mom and baby safe during pregnancy.
One of the important safety considerations during prenatal care is for the doctor to obtain a complete list of all prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, and supplements that the mom is taking.
Some medications and supplements are safe to take during pregnancy. Others aren&amp;rsquo;t and can cause birth defects, brain injuries, or other serious medical conditions.</description></item><item><title>Dallas court of appeals defines when a hospital or doctor's duty to disclose malpractice ends</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/dallas-court-of-appeals-defines-when-a-hospital-or-doctors-duty-to-disclose-malpractice-ends/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/dallas-court-of-appeals-defines-when-a-hospital-or-doctors-duty-to-disclose-malpractice-ends/</guid><description>A statute of limitations is a law that limits the amount of time that a plaintiff has to file a particular type of case. For Texas breach of contract cases, the statute of limitations is four years. For medical malpractice cases, and all types of negligence, the general statute of limitations is two years.

These common-law concepts still exist in every state.

Medical malpractice is a type of negligence. Any negligence claim requires the plaintiff to prove four things: (1) existence of a duty; (2) breach of a duty; (3) proximate cause; and (4) harm.
In the context of health care, the existence of duty is pretty much a given.</description></item><item><title>How do you select the defendants to sue in a Texas medical malpractice case?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-do-you-select-the-defendants-to-sue-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-case/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-do-you-select-the-defendants-to-sue-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-case/</guid><description>Proving medical negligence requires defining a standard of care, demonstrating that a physician, nurse, or hospital didn&amp;rsquo;t meet that standard, and that the poor care caused harm to the patient. Without each and every one of these elements, there&amp;rsquo;s not a valid case.
Thus, when evaluating a medical malpractice case, it&amp;rsquo;s essential to separate acts of negligence from other concerning factors like rudeness, lack of compassion, or mistakes of a doctor or nurse that didn&amp;rsquo;t cause a serious injury.</description></item><item><title>Can I change what I said during my deposition in Texas?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/can-i-change-what-i-said-during-my-deposition-in-texas/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/can-i-change-what-i-said-during-my-deposition-in-texas/</guid><description>There are two types of testimony that are admissible during trial in Texas courts: live testimony and deposition testimony.
Live testimony is what everyone&amp;rsquo;s used to seeing&amp;mdash;a witness is physically present in the courtroom, goes to the witness stand, is sworn in, and answers questions under oath in front of the judge and jury.
Deposition testimony, on the other hand, is obtained before trial. Depositions are usually taken in the office of an attorney or court reporter, in the presence of a certified court reporter and sometimes a videographer.</description></item><item><title>How does a Texas jury assign responsibility among multiple defendants in a medical malpractice case?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-does-a-texas-jury-assign-responsibility-among-multiple-defendants-in-a-medical-malpractice-case/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-does-a-texas-jury-assign-responsibility-among-multiple-defendants-in-a-medical-malpractice-case/</guid><description>At the end of a trial in a Texas medical malpractice case, the judge presents a charge to the jury. The charge is a set of questions that the jury must answer based on the evidence presented in the case.
The first question is whether any defendant&amp;rsquo;s conduct was negligent and caused injury to the plaintiff.
When there are multiple defendants in a case, next comes the proportionate responsibility question. In this question, the jury assigns a percentage responsibility to each defendant for the plaintiff&amp;rsquo;s injuries.</description></item><item><title>Why do Texas medical malpractice lawyers ask so much about a patient's past medical history?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/why-do-texas-medical-malpractice-lawyers-ask-so-much-about-a-patients-past-medical-history/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/why-do-texas-medical-malpractice-lawyers-ask-so-much-about-a-patients-past-medical-history/</guid><description>When doctors and nurses get involved with a patient&amp;rsquo;s care, one of the first things that they want to know is about the past medical history.
Sometimes patients are asked to fill out some preliminary paperwork, but a doctor or nurse should always interview each patient about his or her past medical history&amp;mdash;this is called taking a history. In taking a history, physicians and other healthcare providers ask about past diagnoses, chronic illnesses, surgeries, and any medications that are being taken.</description></item><item><title>What are known risks on a Texas medical informed consent form?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-are-known-risks-on-a-texas-medical-informed-consent-form/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-are-known-risks-on-a-texas-medical-informed-consent-form/</guid><description>Informed consent is a legally-required process in Texas where a doctor or surgeon obtains permission from a patient to provide a treatment or perform a surgery or procedure.
The &amp;ldquo;informed&amp;rdquo; part comes in with the required physician explanation of the risks of the proposed treatment or procedure, risks of alternative treatments, and risks of doing nothing. In other words, a patient can&amp;rsquo;t really be informed unless the physician provides all of the relevant facts.</description></item><item><title>Do I need an expert witness in a Texas medical malpractice case?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/do-i-need-an-expert-witness-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-case/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/do-i-need-an-expert-witness-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-case/</guid><description>Some types of lawsuits don&amp;rsquo;t require expert witnesses. Basic personal injury cases and some contract or business disputes can often get to a jury without expert testimony.
In cases like medical malpractice, where the issues aren&amp;rsquo;t within the normal understanding and experience of jurors, Texas law requires expert testimony to aid the jury.
In medical malpractice lawsuits, Texas Civil Practice &amp;amp; Remedies Code Chapter 74 requires:
&amp;bull; An expert witness with education, knowledge and experience directly related to the alleged negligence.</description></item><item><title>Do I have to file for probate before filing a Texas medical malpractice wrongful death lawsuit?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/do-i-have-to-file-for-probate-before-filing-a-texas-medical-malpractice-wrongful-death-lawsuit/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/do-i-have-to-file-for-probate-before-filing-a-texas-medical-malpractice-wrongful-death-lawsuit/</guid><description>When a person dies because of medical malpractice, there are potential survival claims and wrongful death claims to consider.

Survival claims belong to the estate of the deceased person.

In social media, as in pretty much everything else in life, context is important. Posts to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or other platforms offer a snapshot in time, but don&amp;rsquo;t necessary give a true representation of what the person is experiencing 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The truth is, most people try to put on a happy face in social media postings rather than sharing doom and gloom with the world.</description></item><item><title>Can I sue for medical malpractice in Texas if I signed a consent form?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/can-i-sue-for-medical-malpractice-in-texas-if-i-signed-a-consent-form/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/can-i-sue-for-medical-malpractice-in-texas-if-i-signed-a-consent-form/</guid><description>I can&amp;rsquo;t tell you how many times I&amp;rsquo;ve heard clients share with me that their friends and family members discouraged them from looking into a medical malpractice lawsuit for the simple reason that a patient signed a consent form.
Consent forms are often included in a huge stack of paperwork that a doctor&amp;rsquo;s front-office worker, receptionist, or nurse has a patient fill out before being seen by a doctor. The purpose of consent forms is to make an attempt to comply with the requirement of Texas law for physicians to obtain informed consent.</description></item><item><title>Is it possible to get punitive damages in a Texas medical malpractice lawsuit?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/is-it-possible-to-get-punitive-damages-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-lawsuit/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/is-it-possible-to-get-punitive-damages-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-lawsuit/</guid><description>Yes, a jury may award punitive damages, or exemplary damages as they&amp;rsquo;re called under Texas law, in a medical malpractice lawsuit. There are some tough standards in place, though, that must be met to support punitive damages.
What are punitive (exemplary) damages under Texas law?
Texas Civil Practice &amp;amp; Remedies Code Section 41.001(5) defines exemplary damages as any damages awarded as a penalty or punishment. Thus, exemplary or punitive damages aren&amp;rsquo;t considered economic or non-economic damages.</description></item><item><title>Where can I file my Texas medical malpractice lawsuit?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/where-can-i-file-my-texas-medical-malpractice-lawsuit/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/where-can-i-file-my-texas-medical-malpractice-lawsuit/</guid><description>From time to time, Texas victims of medical malpractice ask us if they can file their lawsuit in federal court or in a state court of a different county than where the medical malpractice took place. The answers to these questions are very factually specific and involve legal doctrines of jurisdiction and venue.
Federal court diversity jurisdiction
Although medical malpractice claims are based on state law negligence concepts, it&amp;rsquo;s still possible to file a lawsuit in federal court in some limited circumstances.</description></item><item><title>What does patient noncompliance mean?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-does-patient-noncompliance-mean/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-does-patient-noncompliance-mean/</guid><description>Compliance and noncompliance are words used by doctors and nurses to describe whether a patient is following instructions and cooperating with recommended treatments.
Compliance means that a patient is being cooperative.
Noncompliance means that a patient isn&amp;rsquo;t being cooperative.
Health care providers document in medical records whether a patient is compliant or noncompliant to help guide future care and, in some cases, to point the blame at patients when something is going wrong.</description></item><item><title>Should I get a copy of my medical records before I leave a Texas hospital, if I think there was medical malpractice?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/should-i-get-a-copy-of-my-medical-records-before-i-leave-a-texas-hospital-if-i-think-there-was-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/should-i-get-a-copy-of-my-medical-records-before-i-leave-a-texas-hospital-if-i-think-there-was-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>If you have questions about the quality of care that was provided to you during hospitalization, I strongly recommend obtaining a copy of your medical records before leaving the Texas hospital. When you ask for the records, be sure to emphasize that you want all of them.
Many hospital records offices seem to think that patients are only interested in physician notes. Oftentimes, though, some of the most useful information may be contained elsewhere, in places like nursing notes, flow sheets, laboratory reports, and radiology reports.</description></item><item><title>How can liens impact a Texas medical malpractice settlement?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-can-liens-impact-a-texas-medical-malpractice-settlement/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-can-liens-impact-a-texas-medical-malpractice-settlement/</guid><description>I can&amp;rsquo;t think of a more dreaded topic for victims of medical malpractice than liens. That&amp;rsquo;s pretty remarkable, given the tort reform mania that&amp;rsquo;s plagued Texas for over 15 years.
When there&amp;rsquo;s a settlement or judgment resulting from medical malpractice, plaintiffs and their attorneys are required by law to protect certain interests of third parties.
As a Houston, Texas medical malpractice attorney, I find this unfair, but it&amp;rsquo;s something that we have to deal with.</description></item><item><title>How does the wrongful death cap work in a Texas medical malpractice lawsuit?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-does-the-wrongful-death-cap-work-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-lawsuit/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-does-the-wrongful-death-cap-work-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-lawsuit/</guid><description>When it comes to a wrongful death claim that&amp;rsquo;s related to medical malpractice, there are two different types of caps that you need to be aware of.
The first cap applies to all medical malpractice cases, whether a death is involved or not. Texas law imposes a cap on non-economic damages. Non-economic damages are those serious, yet intangible, injuries including pain-and-suffering, mental anguish, physical impairment, physical disfigurement, and even the loss of a loved one.</description></item><item><title>Why do I need an expert witness for a Texas medical malpractice case?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/why-do-i-need-an-expert-witness-for-a-texas-medical-malpractice-case/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/why-do-i-need-an-expert-witness-for-a-texas-medical-malpractice-case/</guid><description>When the subject of a lawsuit is outside the normal knowledge of a jury, courts require expert testimony. It&amp;rsquo;s no surprise, then, that medical experts are required by Texas law for medical malpractice cases.
As in all civil cases, it&amp;rsquo;s the plaintiff&amp;rsquo;s (patient&amp;rsquo;s) burden of proof.

I have to admit, I&amp;rsquo;m not a conspiracy theorist and think that most healthcare providers make accurate, although often incomplete, entries in patient medical records. That&amp;rsquo;s not to say, though, that phony records never occur.

All that&amp;rsquo;s involved is preparation of a settlement agreement and release, which the plaintiff signs.

In time, the focus naturally shifts to finding the best care possible for your baby. Some babies may have profound brain injuries that will require a lifetime of round-the-clock care.

These are elements of economic damages that aren&amp;rsquo;t covered by Texas tort reform caps.
When it comes to past medical bills, there&amp;rsquo;s an important catch called the paid versus incurred rule.

Under current Texas tort reform laws, non-economic damages are capped. Non-economic damages are often the most significant damages to a plaintiff and include things like mental anguish, physical impairment, pain and suffering, and the loss of a relationship or consortium.
The amount of the non-economic damages depends on who is sued. If only physicians or other human-being healthcare providers are named as defendants in a medical malpractice lawsuit, the total non-economic damages cap is $250,000.</description></item><item><title>Should I sign informed consent forms in Texas before seeing the doctor?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/should-i-sign-informed-consent-forms-in-texas-before-seeing-the-doctor/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/should-i-sign-informed-consent-forms-in-texas-before-seeing-the-doctor/</guid><description>The short answer is a resounding &amp;ldquo;no.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s important for you, as a patient, to know what you&amp;rsquo;re agreeing to before you sign any paperwork.
Informed consent is an important process where the patient gives a physician permission to provide a treatment or perform a surgery.

While many people seem to benefit from chiropractic care, there&amp;rsquo;s a particular risk at play when a chiropractor manipulates a patient&amp;rsquo;s neck. Vertebral arteries run vertically along both sides of the back of the neck in the same area that a chiropractor adjusts.

One type involves a physician, physician&amp;rsquo;s assistant, or nurse practitioner prescribing the wrong medication for a patient. This could be as simple as writing or typing the wrong drug name.

It&amp;rsquo;s usually a doctor or nurse who whispers this important information and then suggests finding a lawyer.

Most of the time, cerebral palsy is caused by a brain injury before birth or during labor and delivery.
Sometimes the signs and symptoms of cerebral palsy are obvious at birth, but on other occasions they become noticeable between infancy and kindergarten. Look for movement-related symptoms like floppy or rigid arms and legs, floppy or rigid trunk, unusual reflexes, abnormal posture, unsteady gait or walking, swallowing issues, and irregular eye movements.</description></item><item><title>What is discovery in a Texas medical malpractice lawsuit?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-is-discovery-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-lawsuit/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-is-discovery-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-lawsuit/</guid><description>Discovery is the phase of a medical malpractice lawsuit where the parties get information, documents, and materials from each other. Under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, parties don&amp;rsquo;t have a choice about responding. While some hospitals and doctors try to stonewall patients seeking information, once a lawsuit is filed it&amp;rsquo;s a different story.
Written discovery typically starts with requests for disclosure, which require each side to produce standard information, including relevant medical and billing records and documentation showing medical malpractice insurance policy limits.</description></item><item><title>Is misdiagnosis medical malpractice in Texas?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/is-misdiagnosis-medical-malpractice-in-texas/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/is-misdiagnosis-medical-malpractice-in-texas/</guid><description>When you go see a doctor for an illness or symptoms, you&amp;rsquo;re looking for answers. It&amp;rsquo;s the physician&amp;rsquo;s obligation to get a thorough medical history from you, followed by a detailed exam and any necessary testing, like lab work or radiology scans. At that point, the standard of care requires the doctor to form a differential diagnosis.
A differential diagnosis is a list of all medical conditions that may explain a patient&amp;rsquo;s symptoms, as well as the signs and findings identified during the physical exam and through any testing.</description></item><item><title>How long does a cerebral palsy medical malpractice case take in Texas?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-long-does-a-cerebral-palsy-medical-malpractice-case-take-in-texas/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-long-does-a-cerebral-palsy-medical-malpractice-case-take-in-texas/</guid><description>Like other medical malpractice lawsuits, cerebral palsy cases require careful investigation. It&amp;rsquo;s preferable, when possible, to do that investigation before filing a lawsuit. By doing the advance work during the pre-suit period, you can stay in control and develop your case in a way that puts you ahead of the defendants from the start.

Sometimes defendants argue that the patient has a significant past medical history that somehow came into play and caused a bad outcome. They come up with these theories by liberally ordering plaintiffs&amp;rsquo; medical records from as far back as possible. In some situations, the arguments that they come up with are simply absurd.</description></item><item><title>As a parent of a disabled child, how do I know if my child was the victim of medical malpractice in Texas?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/as-a-parent-of-a-disabled-child-how-do-i-know-if-my-child-was-the-victim-of-medical-malpractice-in-texas/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/as-a-parent-of-a-disabled-child-how-do-i-know-if-my-child-was-the-victim-of-medical-malpractice-in-texas/</guid><description>Some disabilities are caused by genetic copying errors when DNA is reproduced. For example, Prader Willi Syndrome is caused by a copying error involving chromosome 15.
Other disabilities are congenital, or inherited from one or both parents. Cystic fibrosis, for example, is caused when someone has a dominant expression of a gene carried by both parents.
Still other disabilities are caused by medical malpractice or negligence. While genetic or congenital disabilities will be present from birth, medical malpractice disabilities are related in time to when the malpractice occurred.</description></item><item><title>My doctors discharged me from the hospital too soon.

In many types of cases, attorneys are able to file a lawsuit quickly and conduct most of the investigation while the matter is pending in court. In Texas, medical malpractice cases aren&amp;rsquo;t that way.

When sepsis advances to the point that it causes vital organ damage and even death, it&amp;rsquo;s called septic shock.
Sometimes infections are caused by&amp;nbsp;negligent medical care and sometimes they&amp;rsquo;re not.
For example, I&amp;rsquo;ve handled many medical negligence cases where patients had a perforated bowel or stomach as a surgical complication. When the surgeon doesn&amp;rsquo;t recognize and repair the hole, the contents of those organs leak into the abdominal cavity and cause an infection that leads to sepsis.</description></item><item><title>How do top Texas medical malpractice attorneys decide whether to take a case?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-do-top-texas-medical-malpractice-attorneys-decide-whether-to-take-a-case/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-do-top-texas-medical-malpractice-attorneys-decide-whether-to-take-a-case/</guid><description>Tort reform advocates falsely claim that there&amp;rsquo;s a significant problem with plaintiffs&amp;rsquo; attorneys filing frivolous lawsuits. The truth is that the best Texas medical malpractice lawyers are careful about what cases they accept and file. There are two main reasons for this, both of which deal with the harms, losses, and damages to a patient.
Not every medical error is negligence
First, not all medical errors amount to medical negligence. If a doctor or nurse makes a mistake while treating a patient, but the patient isn&amp;rsquo;t injured or harmed, then there&amp;rsquo;s no negligence.</description></item><item><title>Do I need to take my medical malpractice case to court in Texas?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/do-i-need-to-take-my-medical-malpractice-case-to-court-in-texas/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/do-i-need-to-take-my-medical-malpractice-case-to-court-in-texas/</guid><description>The gist of this question is whether you can get a settlement without filing suit or, at least, without taking a case all the way to the jury.

A bowel perforation refers to a hole, puncture, rip, or tear&amp;nbsp;of the bowel unintentionally caused by an endoscope or surgical equipment during the procedure.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had cases where a patient experienced this complication with a colonoscopy, gallbladder removal (cholecystectomy), bariatric/weight loss procedure, and many laparoscopic procedures, such as hernia repairs.</description></item><item><title>Can my Texas doctor fire or abandon me as a patient?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/can-my-texas-doctor-fire-or-abandon-me-as-a-patient/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/can-my-texas-doctor-fire-or-abandon-me-as-a-patient/</guid><description>Physicians are not obligated to accept new patients.
Once a doctor has entered into a physician-patient relationship, though, Texas law doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow the doctor to fire or abandon a patient on the spot. Instead, a physician must provide reasonable notice, which should be in writing and allow the patient an opportunity to find a new doctor. Although the Texas Medical Board doesn&amp;rsquo;t define how long reasonable notice must be, 14 to 30 days is considered reasonable.</description></item><item><title>How much does a Texas medical malpractice attorney cost?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-much-does-a-texas-medical-malpractice-attorney-cost/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-much-does-a-texas-medical-malpractice-attorney-cost/</guid><description>Experienced Texas attorneys who focus on medical malpractice cases don&amp;rsquo;t typically cost any more than a run-of-the-mill personal injury attorney. That&amp;rsquo;s why I think it&amp;rsquo;s so important for you to hire an attorney with directly-relevant experience and competence to handle your case.
The difference is that lawyers who regularly handle medical negligence cases know how to manage this complex type of litigation. This includes retaining the appropriate type and number of mandatory medical experts, while avoiding cost overruns.</description></item><item><title>My spouse had an elective outpatient surgery and died in the operating room.

Even though surgeons often describe these procedures as &amp;ldquo;minor,&amp;rdquo; there is still a risk to patients because of general anesthesia issues.
The powerful anesthetic medications administered to patients during surgery alter breathing, respiratory, and heart functions. When something goes wrong, it&amp;rsquo;s critical to take immediate action to prevent the patient from developing a permanent brain injury or even passing away.</description></item><item><title>Does the two-year statute of limitations in Texas start when I discovered there was medical malpractice?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/does-the-two-year-statute-of-limitations-in-texas-start-when-i-discovered-there-was-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/does-the-two-year-statute-of-limitations-in-texas-start-when-i-discovered-there-was-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>The short answer is&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;no.&amp;rdquo;
Figuring out the exact date that the statute of limitations expires under Texas law for a medical negligence case is sometimes complex.
A good starting place is that general statute of limitations in Texas for medical negligence cases is two years after the date of the negligent act or omission by a health care provider. It&amp;rsquo;s never less than two years. In some limited circumstances, the two years starts ticking later, such as when the injured patient is a minor or when the continuing treatment doctrine applies.</description></item><item><title>What can I do to make my hospital stay safer?

Not all medical malpractice is negligence, though.&amp;nbsp;Negligence is medical malpractice where the mistake or error harmed the patient. Under Texas law, a plaintiff files a negligence lawsuit to recover for medical malpractice. To prove a medical negligence case, a plaintiff must prove these elements:</description></item><item><title>A radiologist misread my radiology test.

Common diagnostic radiology scans include MRIs, CTs, ultrasounds, MR angiograms, and CT angiograms.
Physicians who specialize in reading or interpreting radiology scans are called radiologists. Doctors who specialize in radiology scans of the brain, head, and neck are called neuroradiologists.
As a Houston, Texas, medical malpractice lawyer, I see two common mistakes by radiologists and neuroradiologists. Both can cause devastating outcomes for patients.</description></item><item><title>The hospital never explained the risks of a surgical procedure, and I was severely injured during surgery.

Our investigation uncovered that her surgeon never had a true informed consent conversation with her. If he had done so, there was no way she would have agreed to proceed with surgery.
Informed consent means the doctor must give enough information to the patient for the patient to consent, or give permission, for the treatment or surgery.</description></item><item><title>How long does it take to litigate a medical malpractice case in Texas?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-long-does-it-take-to-litigate-a-medical-malpractice-case-in-texas/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-long-does-it-take-to-litigate-a-medical-malpractice-case-in-texas/</guid><description>Medical malpractice cases are complicated and have high requirements for experts, evidence, and proof. As a result, they don&amp;rsquo;t typically settle or resolve without a substantial investment of time and resources.
In my experience, district courts in Houston, Harris County, Texas schedule malpractice cases for trial about one year after they are filed. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean the case will be reached, though, because many other cases will be set for the same time.</description></item><item><title>My daughter had a brachial plexus injury after delivery at a Houston, Texas hospital.

Believe it or not, the brachial plexus is one of them. I had never heard of it then and was surprised to discover that such an important bundle of nerves runs through the armpit, of all places.
The brachial plexus is made up of four cranial nerves (C5, C6, C7, and C8) and one thoracic cranial nerve (T1) from the neck.</description></item><item><title>Can I rely on Medicaid or Medicare to pay for my disabled child's medical needs after a medical mistake?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/can-i-rely-on-medicaid-or-medicare-to-pay-for-my-disabled-childs-medical-needs-after-a-medical-mistake/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/can-i-rely-on-medicaid-or-medicare-to-pay-for-my-disabled-childs-medical-needs-after-a-medical-mistake/</guid><description>The short answer is &amp;ldquo;no.&amp;rdquo;
Medicaid and Medicare are government programs that provided limited benefits to eligible individuals.
To receive Medicaid benefits, most people must fall below a certain family income level. Medicaid has some waiver opportunities, though, that apply to disabled children.
Most Medicare beneficiaries, on the other hand, are over 65 years old. However, a baby or child with disabilities who is approved for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) qualifies for Medicare after being on SSDI for over 24 months.</description></item><item><title>My Texas doctor prescribed the wrong drug for me.

At Painter Law Firm, we get at least a few calls each month from patients who are understandably angry that they were given the wrong drug. If you were given a prescription for the wrong medication by mistake, but weren&amp;rsquo;t injured because of it, there&amp;rsquo;s no basis for a medical malpractice lawsuit even though the doctor made a medical error. Patients may consider filing a complaint against the physician with the Texas Medical Board.</description></item><item><title>My Texas doctor got my due date wrong and now my baby has serious complications.

Providers calculate the due date using the pregnant woman&amp;rsquo;s last menstrual period.
Some women are more precise on providing this information than others, so sometimes the due date is revised. Most providers consider a normal pregnancy to be 38 to 41 weeks, with the average pregnancy lasting nine months, or 40 weeks.</description></item><item><title>What should I do when my doctor says Iâ€™m fine but Iâ€™m not?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-should-i-do-when-my-doctor-says-i%C3%A2m-fine-but-i%C3%A2m-not/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-should-i-do-when-my-doctor-says-i%C3%A2m-fine-but-i%C3%A2m-not/</guid><description>One of the tough things that physicians have to do every day is figure out whether something is wrong with their patients, or if what they&amp;rsquo;re experiencing is within the normal expected range for their condition.
Take for example the situation facing a man who called our office today about a problem he has experienced since an outpatient knee surgery. After the operation, he had inflammation around his knee and noticed fluid discharging from the surgical site.</description></item><item><title>A doctor in a Texas hospital said my baby had hypoxia at birth.

If it was long enough to cause a permanent brain injury, it&amp;rsquo;s called a hypoxic brain injury. In some situations, a baby may suffer from a period of anoxia, which means a total absence of oxygen for some length of time. All of these are dangerous and life-threatening conditions.</description></item><item><title>What kind of lawyer should you choose for a Texas medical malpractice case?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-kind-of-lawyer-should-you-choose-for-a-texas-medical-malpractice-case/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-kind-of-lawyer-should-you-choose-for-a-texas-medical-malpractice-case/</guid><description>There are over 98,000 attorneys licensed to practice law in the State of Texas, and over 28,800 in the Houston area alone. With so many lawyers to choose from, finding the right one to hire for your medical malpractice case might feel challenging.
Many people who are suffering from injuries and harm caused by medical errors have never hired an attorney before&amp;mdash;for any reason. Some are tempted to take the easy route of calling a lawyer who they&amp;rsquo;ve seen on a TV or billboard ad.</description></item><item><title>If the autopsy report says my husband died of natural causes, does that mean I can't file a wrongful death or medical malpractice lawsuit?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/if-the-autopsy-report-says-my-husband-died-of-natural-causes-does-that-mean-i-cant-file-a-wrongful-death-or-medical-malpractice-lawsuit/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/if-the-autopsy-report-says-my-husband-died-of-natural-causes-does-that-mean-i-cant-file-a-wrongful-death-or-medical-malpractice-lawsuit/</guid><description>The short answer is &amp;ldquo;no.&amp;rdquo;
This question comes up a lot with hospitalized patients who died within 24 hours of admission to the hospital. Under Texas law, hospitals must report these deaths to the Medical Examiner&amp;rsquo;s office for investigation. The Medical Examiner may decide that an autopsy is necessary to determine the cause of death.
In an autopsy a pathologist physician examines the body, often orders blood work for a toxicology screen, and performs other testing to reach an opinion on the cause and manner of death.</description></item><item><title>What is considered medical malpractice in Texas?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-is-considered-medical-malpractice-in-texas/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-is-considered-medical-malpractice-in-texas/</guid><description>The classic legal definition of medical malpractice is that the healthcare provider did or didn&amp;rsquo;t do something that a reasonably prudent healthcare provider would have done or not done in the same or similar circumstances.
Think about it like this. When you hire a hospital and physicians to care for you, they&amp;rsquo;re promising that they know what they&amp;rsquo;re doing&amp;mdash;you aren&amp;rsquo;t just hiring a random person off the street! They expect to be paid for their services.</description></item><item><title>My child was diagnosed with cerebral palsy.

While it&amp;rsquo;s often diagnosed in the hospital after labor and delivery, sometimes the full extent of cerebral palsy injuries and impairments won&amp;rsquo;t be known for years to come.
The care needs of each person with cerebral palsy are unique.
When cerebral palsy was caused by medical negligence, pursuing a lawsuit may provide funds to take care of the child&amp;rsquo;s lifetime of care needs.</description></item><item><title>My brother suffered a brain injury following lumbar surgery, but some local attorneys said he doesnâ€™t seem damaged enough for a medical malpractice lawsuit.

In some brain injury cases, the injuries are obvious to anyone meeting the person. In other situations, they&amp;rsquo;re subtler. An experienced medical malpractice attorney knows how to get the evidence necessary to illustrate to the judge and jury the full extent of the harms and losses a brain injury patient has suffered.</description></item><item><title>Whatâ€™s the role of expert witnesses in Texas medical malpractice cases?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what%C3%A2s-the-role-of-expert-witnesses-in-texas-medical-malpractice-cases/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what%C3%A2s-the-role-of-expert-witnesses-in-texas-medical-malpractice-cases/</guid><description>In many types of cases, expert witnesses may be unnecessary. Cases like contract disputes and even car wrecks often don&amp;rsquo;t require experts because the disputes are easily within the understanding of laypeople on a jury.
The type of expert testimony plaintiffs must produce Medical malpractice cases are different.

On the other hand, there are a lot of laws in Texas that make it unlikely that you will be successful.
Your best bet is to hire an attorney&amp;mdash;but not just any attorney, one that has specific medical malpractice trial experience.
In Texas, medical malpractice cases are strictly regulated by a group of tort reform laws generally described as &amp;ldquo;Chapter 74.</description></item></channel></rss>
