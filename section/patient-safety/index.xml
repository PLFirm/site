When it comes to hospital emergency room (ER) care, some medical malpractice claims are downright impossible to pursue under existing law.
On January 12, 2024, the Texas Supreme Court entered an opinion to make it even harder for victims of medical malpractice in hospital emergency rooms to seek justice in Texas courtrooms.</description></item><item><title>Dr. Death Aftermath: Texas Prioritizes Patient Transparency</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/dr.-death-aftermath-texas-prioritizes-patient-transparency/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/dr.-death-aftermath-texas-prioritizes-patient-transparency/</guid><description>In an age of instant access to information, medical care transparency lags woefully behind.&amp;nbsp;
Concealing physician incompetence
In a recent article I wrote, "Patient safety in America is in bad shape", I explain how consumers and patients are kept in the dark, having to trust unknown hospital credentialing committees to evaluate the competence of physicians to provide safe medical care. Even though there&amp;rsquo;s a federally required database full of physician outcome and disciplinary information, it&amp;rsquo;s off limits to the public.</description></item><item><title>Patient safety in America is in bad shape</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/patient-safety-in-america-is-in-bad-shape/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/patient-safety-in-america-is-in-bad-shape/</guid><description>As a former hospital administrator, knowing that medical malpractice is the third leading cause of death still surprises me. After all, hospital, medical, and nursing leaders spend a significant amount of time analyzing ways to improve processes and patient safety. The data suggest, though, that these efforts consistently come up short.
I think a lot of this has to do with noise.
Physicians and healthcare providers are expected to see more patients in less time than ever before.</description></item><item><title>Data show a big difference between hospital and office anesthesia safety</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/data-show-a-big-difference-between-hospital-and-office-anesthesia-safety/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/data-show-a-big-difference-between-hospital-and-office-anesthesia-safety/</guid><description>Today&amp;#39;s healthcare consumers have more choices than ever before. When it comes to surgeries and procedures, patients have the option of having them done in an office setting or a hospital operating room. Patients also have the option of selecting a physician anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist to provide anesthesia care, although many facilities do not present it as a choice.

Although it&amp;rsquo;s more common in the black community, sickle cell disease can affect people in any race or ethnic group.
What is sickle cell disease?
Red blood cells have iron-containing hemoglobin, which carry oxygen. They&amp;rsquo;re normally circular in shape.
When a person has sickle cell disease, there&amp;rsquo;s a distorted special type of hemoglobin, called hemoglobin S.</description></item><item><title>Understanding advanced practice nurses and their scope of practice and accountability in Texas</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/understanding-advanced-practice-nurses-and-their-scope-of-practice-and-accountability-in-texas/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/understanding-advanced-practice-nurses-and-their-scope-of-practice-and-accountability-in-texas/</guid><description>The Texas Board of Nursing recognizes a special category of registered nurses called &amp;ldquo;Advanced Practice Nurses.&amp;rdquo; The Board grants licensure based on a nurse&amp;rsquo;s completion of an advanced educational program acceptable to the Board.
What are advanced practice nurses?
Texas Board of Nursing Rule 221.1 notes that advanced practice nurses include nurse practitioners, nurse midwives, nurse anesthetists (certified registered nurse anesthetists or CRNAs), and clinical nurse specialists.
Nationally, there&amp;rsquo;s been a robust debate on the scope of practice boundaries for advanced practice nurses.</description></item><item><title>Medical malpractice in foot and ankle surgery: Comparing podiatrists and orthopedic surgeons</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/medical-malpractice-in-foot-and-ankle-surgery-comparing-podiatrists-and-orthopedic-surgeons/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/medical-malpractice-in-foot-and-ankle-surgery-comparing-podiatrists-and-orthopedic-surgeons/</guid><description>Medical studies have shown that up to one-third of the U.S. population suffers from foot or ankle pain.
Options for foot and ankle treatment
When seeking surgical care for foot and ankle issues, patients have two options.
Podiatrists are surgeons who specialize in surgery and medical care (non-surgical) for the ankle and foot. The practice of podiatrists overlaps with that of orthopedic surgeons who specialize in the same parts of body.</description></item><item><title>Hospitals are responsible for poor communication of critical values by their labs</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/hospitals-are-responsible-for-poor-communication-of-critical-values-by-their-labs/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/hospitals-are-responsible-for-poor-communication-of-critical-values-by-their-labs/</guid><description>Many Texans are surprised to learn that hospitals are generally not responsible for the mistakes and negligence of physicians. Despite billboards and advertisements suggesting otherwise, physicians are not typically employees of hospitals. The corporate practice of medicine doctrine prohibits hospitals from practicing medicine, which is the province of physicians. However, the theoretical versus actual implementation of this doctrine can be robustly debated.
When investigating potential cases of medical negligence involving hospital care, we closely examine the care provided by hospital employees.</description></item><item><title>Could AI help prevent hyponatremia sodium complications after surgery?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/could-ai-help-prevent-hyponatremia-sodium-complications-after-surgery/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/could-ai-help-prevent-hyponatremia-sodium-complications-after-surgery/</guid><description>The world is abuzz with the advent of ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence (AI) platforms. That&amp;rsquo;s why I wasn&amp;rsquo;t surprised by the Wall Street Journal&amp;rsquo;s reporting that hospitals are unleashing AI to tackle medical errors.
Some hospitals are using AI to help prevent medication mishaps, reduce patient falls, avoid surgical complications, and prevent dangerous infections.
Since HIPAA (the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) became law, hospitals have rapidly converted their old system of handwritten medical records into electronic systems.</description></item><item><title>Mom dies after childbirth, hospital under investigation</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/mom-dies-after-childbirth-hospital-under-investigation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/mom-dies-after-childbirth-hospital-under-investigation/</guid><description>A 31-year-old black woman died after her daughter was born by emergency C-Section.

Three surprising facts about maternal mortality
It&amp;rsquo;s hard to imagine something sadder than a baby whose mom dies around childbirth. Yet, this happens around 700 times each year in the United States.

We&amp;rsquo;ll call the patient Bill.
Bill was experiencing pain because of gallstones and went to the hospital for treatment. A gastroenterologist physician saw him. We&amp;rsquo;ll call him Dr. Smith.
According to the medical malpractice lawsuit, Bill needed a surgery called ERCP, or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. ERCP is a specialized procedure performed by gastroenterology physicians to explore and fix problems with the bile system and pancreatic ducts.</description></item><item><title>Can hospitals run ERs without emergency physicians?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/can-hospitals-run-ers-without-emergency-physicians/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/can-hospitals-run-ers-without-emergency-physicians/</guid><description>It seems like it would be hard to run an emergency room without emergency physicians, right?
According to recent reporting from National Public Radio, that&amp;rsquo;s the goal of private equity firms who are buying up emergency medicine practice groups. Private equity firms are investment partnerships that buy companies, reorganize them to generate more profit, and then resell them.

Their staffing and scope of services often&amp;mdash;and probably deliberately&amp;mdash;blur the line between what&amp;rsquo;s a medical service and what&amp;rsquo;s an esthetician or spa service.
Under Texas law, med spas are often regulated by two separate agencies. The Texas Department of Licensing &amp;amp; Regulation oversees cosmetology and esthetician services.

Some states, such as Texas, allow nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs) to make a medical diagnosis and prescribe medications, as long as their supervised by a physician. What that supervision looks like varies dramatically. In some cases, it&amp;rsquo;s a team approach. In other cases, there&amp;rsquo;s virtually no supervision at all.

What happened that led to this?
A patient&amp;mdash;we&amp;rsquo;ll call him Bill&amp;mdash;was a man in his late 50s who went to an ambulatory surgery center (ASC) for left shoulder arthroscopy (shoulder surgery) with rotator cuff repair.

This fact sometimes gets glossed over, though, in patient-surgeon discussions. This is true for emergency surgeries, but also elective surgeries, including plastic or cosmetic surgery and eye procedures.
Patients are typically focused on the benefits of having the surgery. For most surgeons&amp;mdash;who do this type of work every day&amp;mdash;performing surgeries and procedures are routine and complications are rare. That explains why risks are often not at the front of their minds.</description></item><item><title>Spinal epidural abscess misdiagnosis causes paralysis</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/spinal-epidural-abscess-misdiagnosis-causes-paralysis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/spinal-epidural-abscess-misdiagnosis-causes-paralysis/</guid><description>A man in his 30s went to a Texas hospital emergency room (ER) three days in a row to be seen for back pain.

Some circumstances require immediate placement of a breathing (endotracheal) tube into the patient&amp;rsquo;s trachea (windpipe) to secure the airway. This is a medical procedure called intubation.
Anesthesiologists are physicians who are airway experts. Sometimes an anesthesiologist is in the operating room (OR) providing anesthesia care.

Advocacy requires nurses to exercise critical thinking to identify situations that are unsafe for patients and to speak up to get action.
When we discuss nursing advocacy, it&amp;rsquo;s typically in the context of a medical malpractice lawsuit, when nurses didn&amp;rsquo;t do what they should have done.
For example, just today I was working with an emergency nursing expert witness in a case where the absence of nursing advocacy contributed to a tragic outcome for our client.</description></item><item><title>The nurse's role in medication safety</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-nurses-role-in-medication-safety/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-nurses-role-in-medication-safety/</guid><description>When I take the deposition of a registered nurse (RN), I often ask questions about the administration of medications. Nurses and their attorneys often try the &amp;ldquo;Nuremberg defense&amp;rdquo; of &amp;ldquo;I was just following orders,&amp;rdquo; but in reality, nurses owe their patients a higher level of care.

And that perspective guides recommendations for a patient&amp;rsquo;s plan of care.
This is one reason why considering a second opinion on elective or non-emergency medical or surgical care is often a good idea.
Another reason we see from time to time is that some physicians, surgeons, and providers seem eager to proceed with the costliest, often invasive, treatment before trying other more conservative approaches.</description></item><item><title>When nurses override medication warnings, it places patients at a higher risk</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/when-nurses-override-medication-warnings-it-places-patients-at-a-higher-risk/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/when-nurses-override-medication-warnings-it-places-patients-at-a-higher-risk/</guid><description>Giving medication in a hospital setting isn&amp;rsquo;t always as straight-forward as it seems.

Her comment got me thinking about how old school medical care is different than what’s touted as improved care today.

Of course, many physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, nurses and other personnel have worked in the front line in treating people battling the coronavirus. But the pandemic has also highlighted some hospital system problems that have long been in place.
A great example of this is nurse staffing ratios.

Thrombocytopenia is normally diagnosed through laboratory testing called a complete blood count (CBC). When a CBC test reveals that the patient has thrombocytopenia, a surprising number of physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners take a &amp;ldquo;wait and see&amp;rdquo; approach rather than investigating the potential causes for the low platelet count.</description></item><item><title>What's in a name?

And, of course, accreditation is necessary for facilities to receive Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance payments.</description></item><item><title>Surgical checklists reduce errors, save lives</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surgical-checklists-reduce-errors-save-lives/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surgical-checklists-reduce-errors-save-lives/</guid><description>Studies of shown that hospitals requiring use of surgical safety checklists have better outcomes than those who don&amp;rsquo;t.

Most people are more familiar with their well-known neighbor, the thyroid gland. The parathyroid and thyroid glands, though, have different independent roles that are equally important.
The grain-of-rice-sized parathyroid glands secret an eponymous substance called parathyroid hormone (PTH).

Triage nurses perform a quick assessment of patients to determine who needs seen most urgently. ER physicians, physician assistants (PAs), and nurse practitioners (NPs) evaluate patients and order testing to determine which patients need admitted to the hospital and those who should be discharged home.
One of the important determining factors concerning discharges is whether a patient is medically stable.

In recent years, Medicare and private insurance companies have pushed a trend that requires discharge planning to start immediately upon admission. The reason&amp;mdash;cost savings&amp;mdash;is completely transparent.
The heavy lifting of discharge planning falls on registered nurses, case managers, and social workers.

Most Texans don&amp;rsquo;t understand that an old legal concept called the corporate practice of medicine doctrine prohibits hospitals from employing or hiring doctors.</description></item><item><title>Closed-loop communication prevents critical lab, radiology results from going unnoticed</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/closed-loop-communication-prevents-critical-lab-radiology-results-from-going-unnoticed/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/closed-loop-communication-prevents-critical-lab-radiology-results-from-going-unnoticed/</guid><description>Before going to law school, I was a hospital administrator. One of the hats that I wore in that job was that of the officer coordinating Joint Commission compliance.
The Joint Commission is the nation&amp;rsquo;s oldest hospital-accrediting organization. I can tell you that hospital leaders take their standards seriously, because failure to maintain accreditation puts funding from Medicare, Medicaid, and even third-party health insurance companies at risk.
Part of the accreditation process that the Joint Commission oversees is constantly raising the bar to improve healthcare and patient safety.</description></item><item><title>Bungled MRI, communication leads to man's permanent paralysis</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/bungled-mri-communication-leads-to-mans-permanent-paralysis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/bungled-mri-communication-leads-to-mans-permanent-paralysis/</guid><description>This story of a man in his 50s and a bungled MRI scan illustrates what can happen when doctors and nurses don&amp;rsquo;t talk to each other.
The situation started when this man went to a hospital emergency room after a week of flu-like symptoms including the typical fatigue, nausea, and vomiting, but also with problems keeping his balance and walking.

Radiologists are doctors with specialized training after medical school focused on how to interpret a variety of diagnostic radiological studies including x-rays, CT scans, MRI scans, and angiograms. Neuroradiologists have additional training focused on interpreting images of the brain and nervous system.
The most frequent allegation in medical malpractice claims against radiologists and neuroradiologists is that the interpretation was botched.</description></item><item><title>What you should know about spinal epidural abscess and medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-you-should-know-about-spinal-epidural-abscess-and-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-you-should-know-about-spinal-epidural-abscess-and-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>A spinal epidural abscess is a dangerous medical condition that can compress the spinal cord and cause permanent injury.
An abscess is an accumulation of pus caused by an infection. The epidural space is an area between the layers of the dura mater, which is the outermost protective layer of the spinal cord and brain.

CSF is the clear, colorless liquid that surrounds the spinal cord and brain. Adults have about two-thirds of a cup of cerebrospinal fluid, which plays several important roles. CSF is a shock absorber that protects the brain and spinal cord, transports nutrients and oxygen from the blood to the brain and spinal cord, and removes waste from brain cells.</description></item><item><title>Ophthalmology, eyes diseases, and medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/ophthalmology-eyes-diseases-and-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/ophthalmology-eyes-diseases-and-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>Ophthalmology is the medical specialty dedicated to diseases of the eye.
There&amp;rsquo;s sometimes confusion over the training and role of ophthalmologists versus optometrists.

Coumadin (generic name warfarin) is a prescription drug that&amp;rsquo;s a blood thinner, or anticoagulant. Warfarin has been around since the 1940s and works by reducing the formation of blood clots.
Doctors frequently write long-term prescriptions for coumadin to prevent heart attacks, strokes, or other cardiovascular conditions.
Coumadin/warfarin use doesn&amp;rsquo;t come without risks, though. The most prominent risks are that it can decrease the body&amp;rsquo;s ability to stop internal bleeding and even cause death if the dosage is incorrect.</description></item><item><title>Diabetes, bedsores, and medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/diabetes-bedsores-and-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/diabetes-bedsores-and-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>Bedsores, pressure ulcers, decubitus ulcers&amp;mdash;they have lots of names, but whatever you call them, they have dreaded consequences for patients. They form when there&amp;rsquo;s unrelieved external pressure that cuts off blood supply to tissue, killing cells and leading to ulcers.
When bedsores develop in hospitalized patients, they lead to longer stays. In severe cases, they trigger complications such as infection and sepsis that can kill a person.
Medical studies have shown that there are several risk factors that increase the likelihood that a person may develop bedsores:</description></item><item><title>The most common types of pediatrician medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-most-common-types-of-pediatrician-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-most-common-types-of-pediatrician-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>Pediatricians have the complex job of treating patients from newborns to age 18.

Accreditation standards require all hospitals&amp;nbsp;to do this. Under certain circumstances, hospitals are required to perform a root cause analysis and document a plan on how to prevent the same error from occurring in the future.
Unfortunately, the powerful hospital lobbyists convinced Texas legislators to grant broad privileges to hospitals to keep this information secret from the public, including attorneys, parties to litigation, and courts.</description></item><item><title>What you should know about home health nursing and malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-you-should-know-about-home-health-nursing-and-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-you-should-know-about-home-health-nursing-and-malpractice/</guid><description>Home health nurses can be a tremendous help to patients who are stable enough to go home from the hospital, but still have care needs.

Unfortunately, Elaine&amp;rsquo;s management approach isn&amp;rsquo;t purely fictional. In healthcare settings, some hospital leaders follow the Elaine approach when it comes to dangerous doctors.
When hospital quality improvement or medical peer review activities uncover problems with surgeons or physicians, spineless hospital leaders work out sweetheart deals with the doctors involved to let them go to another hospital rather than face medical staff discipline.</description></item><item><title>The peril of automatically blaming concerning signs and symptoms on narcotic medication effect</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-peril-of-automatically-blaming-concerning-signs-and-symptoms-on-narcotic-medication-effect/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-peril-of-automatically-blaming-concerning-signs-and-symptoms-on-narcotic-medication-effect/</guid><description>When a hospitalized patient is recovering from a surgery, there must be a careful balance between pain control and over-medication, which can mask signs and symptoms that there&amp;rsquo;s a serious complication.
Carefully monitoring how a patient responds to pain medications is a responsibility that is shared by surgeons, other physicians, and hospital nursing staff.

Two common conditions that ophthalmology doctors see are glaucoma and retinal detachment.
Glaucoma is actually a group of conditions that impact the optic nerve based on abnormally high pressure within the eye. Either an over-production of fluid, called the aqueous humor, in the eye or poor drainage causes the build-up in pressure.
Glaucoma symptoms vary based on the exact condition and how long it&amp;rsquo;s been present.</description></item><item><title>Texas Medical Board disciplines Houston Methodist Hospital pain management doctor for performing unnecessary surgery</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-medical-board-disciplines-houston-methodist-hospital-pain-management-doctor-for-performing-unnecessary-surgery/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-medical-board-disciplines-houston-methodist-hospital-pain-management-doctor-for-performing-unnecessary-surgery/</guid><description>Any time a patient goes to surgery, there are risks.

Medically-indicated care versus unnecessary care
With these risks in mind, it&amp;rsquo;s critical for physicians and surgeons only to perform surgeries that are medical indicated and necessary. While the doctor stands to make money on these types of procedures, they pose an unnecessary risk to patients.</description></item><item><title>One of the most common drug errors is giving 10 times the correct dose</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/one-of-the-most-common-drug-errors-is-giving-10-times-the-correct-dose/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/one-of-the-most-common-drug-errors-is-giving-10-times-the-correct-dose/</guid><description>Prescription drug overdose is a common type of medical malpractice caused by doctors, other prescribers, and pharmacists.

With any surgery, there is an expectation that a patient will have some degree of pain. Thorough, accurate pain assessments that are properly documented establish a baseline that doctors and nurses can refer to when determining whether the patient is improving, getting worse, or staying the same.

Add new (acute) abdominal pain and it becomes a potential surgical emergency.
Symptoms &amp;amp; Diagnosis
When working up a patient for potential bowel obstruction, providers consider the textbook symptoms of abdominal pain and swelling (distention), vomiting, and the inability to pass flatus. Some patients describe it as feeling &amp;ldquo;backed up.&amp;rdquo;
One of the first tasks&amp;nbsp; for physicians is to determine what&amp;rsquo;s causing the obstruction.</description></item><item><title>Medicare identifies ongoing quality of care concerns at CHI St. Luke's Health Baylor St. Luke's Medical Center</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/medicare-identifies-ongoing-quality-of-care-concerns-at-chi-st.-lukes-health-baylor-st.-lukes-medical-center/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/medicare-identifies-ongoing-quality-of-care-concerns-at-chi-st.-lukes-health-baylor-st.-lukes-medical-center/</guid><description>Up until a few years ago, it was unusual to hear a patient or family member complain about care provided at CHI St. Luke&amp;rsquo;s Health Baylor St. Luke&amp;rsquo;s Medical Center.

Many surgeons were taught that a precise surgical cut would heal better than a natural tear that might happen as the baby passes through the birth canal.
The standard of care has changed, though, and now discourages OB/GYN doctors from routinely performing episiotomies. Mounting evidence shows that the painful procedure often causes more trouble than benefits for women.</description></item><item><title>Compare birth-related complication rates of 18 Houston hospitals</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/compare-birth-related-complication-rates-of-18-houston-hospitals/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/compare-birth-related-complication-rates-of-18-houston-hospitals/</guid><description>Hospitals usually like to keep the public in the dark about bad outcomes, complications, or problems that occur.

The textbook sign of preeclampsia is pregnancy-related high blood pressure (hypertension). Some people describe it as a silent killer because no one can feel the increase in blood pressure.

The statistics are sobering.
Around 130 people die in the United States daily after an opioid overdose. A significant chunk of that statistic comes from overdoses of prescription pain relievers and synthetic opioids like fentanyl. Around one fourth of chronic pain patients prescribed opioids misuse them and 8-12% of them become addicted.
Then there&amp;rsquo;s the issue of prescription drugs acting as gateways to illicit use.</description></item><item><title>FDA cautions that robotic surgery is unproven and potentially dangerous for cancer surgeries</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/fda-cautions-that-robotic-surgery-is-unproven-and-potentially-dangerous-for-cancer-surgeries/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/fda-cautions-that-robotic-surgery-is-unproven-and-potentially-dangerous-for-cancer-surgeries/</guid><description>The men and women in suits who run hospitals love to advertise when their facilities offer robotic surgery. In many cases, they suggest that robotic surgery offers greater safety and other benefits to patients when compared to conventional surgical procedures.
It&amp;rsquo;s understandable that they want to recover the significant investment required to purchase robotic surgical equipment. Yet, a growing body of research shows that claims about the superiority of robotic surgery aren&amp;rsquo;t backed up by any evidence.</description></item><item><title>Breast cancer after a negative mammogram</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/breast-cancer-after-a-negative-mammogram/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/breast-cancer-after-a-negative-mammogram/</guid><description>A mammogram is a specialized x-ray scan of the breasts used to look for breast cancer.

Mammogram recommendations
The American Cancer Society&amp;rsquo;s guidelines for mammograms recommend that women:
&amp;bull; Ages 40-44 should have the option to start having mammograms for breast cancer screening.
&amp;bull; Ages 45-54 should have a mammogram every year.
&amp;bull; Ages 55 and older could switch to mammograms every other year, or could continue to have one annually.</description></item><item><title>Three steps you can take to prevent pharmacy errors</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/three-steps-you-can-take-to-prevent-pharmacy-errors/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/three-steps-you-can-take-to-prevent-pharmacy-errors/</guid><description>Pharmacy medication mistakes happen more often than you might think.

In some situations, sudden abdominal pain can be life-threatening. That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s important to get checked out by a physician immediately. Appendicitis is one example.

In my practice as a Houston, Texas medical malpractice lawyer, I&amp;rsquo;ve handled numerous hospital and nursing home (skilled nursing facility or SNF) cases where another aspect of pain management is the issue.

The most common anesthesia malpractice cases involve patients under general anesthesia who experience respiratory or heart complications that aren&amp;rsquo;t managed properly by the anesthesia provider.

Opioids are a highly-regulated class of powerful narcotic medications including painkillers like fentanyl, oxycodone, hydrocodone, codeine, and morphine.
Like their illegal cousin, heroin, prescription opioids are highly addictive and can get people hooked on them in as little as one dose.

These are two of the most common comments that I hear from my clients as a Houston, Texas medical malpractice attorney. In fact, I think it&amp;rsquo;s rare that new clients don&amp;rsquo;t say one of those phrases during our initial meetings with them.
Texas law helps hospitals hide the truth

Sadly, in my experience, many Texas hospitals, nurses, and doctors continue to repeat the same mistakes over and over again, causing avoidable patient injuries and death. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be that way, though.

As a Houston, Texas medical malpractice attorney, I used to spend a lot of time with my legal nurse consultant trying to decipher what handwritten medical entries said. With the advent of electronic medical records, this is not so much an issue anymore.
Some facilities, though, use a mix of handwritten and electronic medical records. Many anesthesiologists and certified registered nurse anesthetists, for example, still use handwritten record that they complete during the procedure.</description></item><item><title>Journal article: ER should treat for stroke if patient has dizziness and difficulty walking or standing</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/journal-article-er-should-treat-for-stroke-if-patient-has-dizziness-and-difficulty-walking-or-standing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/journal-article-er-should-treat-for-stroke-if-patient-has-dizziness-and-difficulty-walking-or-standing/</guid><description>I met with an emergency medicine expert today to discuss a medical malpractice case that Painter Law Firm is currently investigating in the Houston area. Because Texas law requires medical malpractice plaintiffs to have a medical expert report early in the litigation process, our practice is to consult with medical experts before a lawsuit is filed.

This is the first step in a process that is called medication reconciliation.
At some doctor&amp;rsquo;s offices, clerks hand patients a stack of paperwork to fill out, burying the medication history form among them.

When a doctor continues to practice medicine, with an unstable, untreated mental health illness, it can pose an immediate danger to patient safety.</description></item><item><title>Head or chest trauma is important for emergency room providers to know about and evaluate</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/head-or-chest-trauma-is-important-for-emergency-room-providers-to-know-about-and-evaluate/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/head-or-chest-trauma-is-important-for-emergency-room-providers-to-know-about-and-evaluate/</guid><description>Any time a person goes to the emergency room and reports trauma to the head or chest, it should raise red flags to the triage nurse, emergency physician, and other healthcare providers.

While many people may be most familiar with nurse practitioners providing primary care, they also participate in other specialty areas, including post-operative care for surgical patients.
Under Texas law, the Nursing Practice Act refers to nurse practitioners as Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs). While nurse practitioners are allowed to see patients independently, the Nursing Practice Act requires them to have a written collaborative practice agreement with at least one medical doctor.</description></item><item><title>Which Houston-area hospitals have abnormally-high infection rates?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/which-houston-area-hospitals-have-abnormally-high-infection-rates/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/which-houston-area-hospitals-have-abnormally-high-infection-rates/</guid><description>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), hospitals in the State of Texas have a significantly worse infection rate for the hospital-acquired infection Clostridium difficile (C. diff.), in comparison to the rest of the country.

Signs and symptoms
According to the Preeclampsia Foundation, expectant mothers with preeclampsia often do not notice any symptoms. Many of the signs of preeclampsia, though, can be measured by healthcare professionals during prenatal visits.</description></item><item><title>Why it may be dangerous for your doctor to prescribe Cipro or Levaquin</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/why-it-may-be-dangerous-for-your-doctor-to-prescribe-cipro-or-levaquin/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/why-it-may-be-dangerous-for-your-doctor-to-prescribe-cipro-or-levaquin/</guid><description>In July 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved safety labeling changes for a class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones.
Fluoroquinolones are prescribed to kill infection-causing bacteria or to stop them from growing. FDA-approved drugs in this class include levofloxacin (Levaquin), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), moxifloxacin (Avelox), ofloxacin, and Gemifloxacin (Factive).
The FDA ordered safety labeling changes for these drugs because of risks that were uncovered under an FDA safety review. Research has shown an association between fluoroquinolone use, whether in oral form or by injection, and severe and sometimes permanent side effects including damage to tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and the central nervous system.</description></item><item><title>Is office-based anesthesia really safe?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/is-office-based-anesthesia-really-safe/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/is-office-based-anesthesia-really-safe/</guid><description>As a Houston, Texas medical malpractice attorney, I have handled a number of cases involving complications from office-based anesthesia services.

An advance directive is a written document that summarizes a person&amp;rsquo;s health care wishes and preferences. I think it is a good idea to have an advance directive because it benefits both healthcare providers and family members in making treatment decisions when a person is incapacitated.

Hospitalized patients have an attending physician who is responsible for overseeing their care. Surgeons sometimes fill this role for surgical patients, at least until the operation has been completed. After that, a hospitalist (often an internal medicine doctor who has a hospital-based practice) often takes over. In other hospitals, a hospitalist is assigned as the attending physician to each newly admitted patient, from the get-go.</description></item><item><title>Texas government database allows free searches for hospital infection rates, preventable adverse events</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-government-database-allows-free-searches-for-hospital-infection-rates-preventable-adverse-events/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-government-database-allows-free-searches-for-hospital-infection-rates-preventable-adverse-events/</guid><description>The Texas Department of State Health Services operates a new and useful and interesting program requiring hospital reporting of Preventable Adverse Events.

As laypeople, we can spot potential blood in the urine by an appearance that is bright red or cola colored.</description></item><item><title>Sport physical essentials and medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/sport-physical-essentials-and-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/sport-physical-essentials-and-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>Most school districts and private schools require student athletes to have a physical for playing on a school sports team. Quite often, many people view the sports physical, or pre-participation screening, as a check-the-box exercise that has little importance. Sometimes schools have a rushed assembly line for sports physicals, just before the deadline.
Thinking back to when I played high school basketball, I think I understand why this frequently happens. I was like most young people, thinking that I had no physical limitation that would prevent me from engaging in sports.</description></item><item><title>Shoulder dystocia birth injury risks and medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/shoulder-dystocia-birth-injury-risks-and-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/shoulder-dystocia-birth-injury-risks-and-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>Shoulder dystocia is a condition that can occur during natural labor and delivery, when the baby&amp;rsquo;s head is delivered but the shoulder gets stuck behind the pubic symphysis. It is an emergency because it requires fast recognition and action by the OB/GYN doctor to avoid a significant permanent injury to the baby, and possibly the mother.
Who is at risk? While most obstetrics/gynecology physicians find shoulder dystocia difficult to predict, the general risk factors are well-known.</description></item><item><title>Bariatric weight-loss surgery benefits, risks, and medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/bariatric-weight-loss-surgery-benefits-risks-and-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/bariatric-weight-loss-surgery-benefits-risks-and-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>As bariatric weight-loss procedures have become increasingly popular, I have handled more and more bariatric surgery cases in my law practice as a Houston, Texas medical malpractice attorney.

Who is responsible for nursing malpractice?
In Texas, nurses are almost always employed by hospitals. The standard of care requires hospitals to make sure that its nurses are competent to provide the care that they are assigned to handle. This includes an obligation to provide ongoing training to nurses, as well as annual assessments and documentation of each nurse&amp;rsquo;s competencies.</description></item><item><title>X-rays and CT scans: Radiation risk and malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/x-rays-and-ct-scans-radiation-risk-and-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/x-rays-and-ct-scans-radiation-risk-and-malpractice/</guid><description>In most of the cases that I handle, in my career as a Houston, Texas medical malpractice lawyer, patients have had some type of radiology study. It could be an x-ray, CT scan, MRI scan, or other study.

Although there are various prenatal options for expectant moms, in my experience as a Houston, Texas medical malpractice lawyer, seeking care from a board certified OB/GYN is the safest choice.
Seeking early prenatal care is important because it establishes a baseline for the development of the baby, and increases the safety of both the baby and mother.</description></item><item><title>What you should know about peripheral arterial disease and revascularization surgery malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-you-should-know-about-peripheral-arterial-disease-and-revascularization-surgery-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-you-should-know-about-peripheral-arterial-disease-and-revascularization-surgery-malpractice/</guid><description>Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is caused by plaque building up, hardening, and narrowing arteries that carry oxygen-rich blood.

In my law practice as a Houston, Texas medical malpractice attorney, one of the most common questions I hear from clients is &amp;ldquo;How can they let this doctor keep hurting people?&amp;rdquo;

Undocumented healthcare

It is easy to understand why business-savvy hospitals started hiring PA&amp;rsquo;s and NP&amp;rsquo;s&amp;mdash;they are cheaper than physicians. In addition to their cost effectiveness, the general idea is these mid-level providers can handle common, basic illnesses, freeing up doctors to handle more complex diagnoses and conditions.</description></item><item><title>New Texas law will protect patients from hostile do-not-resuscitate/DNR orders</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/new-texas-law-will-protect-patients-from-hostile-do-not-resuscitate/dnr-orders/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/new-texas-law-will-protect-patients-from-hostile-do-not-resuscitate/dnr-orders/</guid><description>In my experience as a Houston , Texas medical malpractice lawyer, I believe that the most shocking Texas laws that I share with clients is that doctors can enter a do not resuscitate (DNR) without the patient or family&amp;rsquo;s consent&amp;mdash;or even knowledge.

Healthcare professionals use the term &amp;ldquo;discharge planning&amp;rdquo; to describe the entire process of beginning care all the way through transitioning a patient from hospitalization to discharge to home or another facility.

A hematoma is a solid collection of clotted blood. Hematoma sometimes form following a spinal surgery, and orthopedic and neurosurgical experts often refer to them as a compressive lesion.

In recent years, researchers have devoted a significant amount of attention to this problem, in the hope of improving patient safety and outcomes.</description></item><item><title>Lawsuit: Nurse does not follow newborn safe-sleeping rules, baby dies</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/lawsuit-nurse-does-not-follow-newborn-safe-sleeping-rules-baby-dies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/lawsuit-nurse-does-not-follow-newborn-safe-sleeping-rules-baby-dies/</guid><description>As a Houston, Texas medical malpractice lawyer, I have represented a lot of clients in cases involving serious injuries and deaths of newborn babies and children, both in labor and delivery and in the early years of life.

Here is a good example. A person has a fever and sore throat for two days, and then wakes up the next morning with loud breathing sounds.

Skilled nursing facilities (also called SNFs) are facilities that provide rehabilitation care to Medicare beneficiaries.</description></item><item><title>Comparing care at teaching hospitals to non-teaching hospitals</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/comparing-care-at-teaching-hospitals-to-non-teaching-hospitals/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/comparing-care-at-teaching-hospitals-to-non-teaching-hospitals/</guid><description>In May 2017, the Journal of the American Medical Association published the results of a study looking into the difference in outcomes between patients admitted to major teaching hospitals, versus patients admitted to minor teaching hospitals or non-teaching hospitals.

Some risks are avoidable and some are unavoidable.
One foreseeable complication is that the stress of surgery can trigger cardiac, or heart, complications, such as a heart attack (myocardial infarction), arrhythmia (an irregular heart rhythm), and acute coronary conditions.&amp;nbsp;
This is a particular concern considering the multiplication of surgical procedures being done on patients in their 50s, 60s, and older, where the risk of cardiac complications is higher.</description></item><item><title>Rushed doctors can place outdated, inaccurate information in your electronic medical record</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/rushed-doctors-can-place-outdated-inaccurate-information-in-your-electronic-medical-record/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/rushed-doctors-can-place-outdated-inaccurate-information-in-your-electronic-medical-record/</guid><description>How reliable is the information that your doctor is using to diagnose and treat you?

Most of these procedures are done for outpatient routine screening purposes in relatively healthy people. Some, though, are to investigate, and sometimes treat, bleeding and digestive issues.
Colonoscopies are procedures where a doctor inserts a flexible scope and camera through your rectum, to be able to inspect the inside of your colon.
In an EGD, also called an upper endoscopy, the doctor inserts the flexible scope and camera down your throat to be able to look inside your upper digestive track, including the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum.</description></item><item><title>How safe are surgical centers and doctor-owned hospitals?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-safe-are-surgical-centers-and-doctor-owned-hospitals/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-safe-are-surgical-centers-and-doctor-owned-hospitals/</guid><description>It is no secret that America&amp;rsquo;s healthcare system is in a constant financial crisis.

Hi, I&amp;#39;m Robert Painter. Today I want to talk to you about brain injuries, and one specific tip on how you can avoid brain injuries during a hospitalization.
There are a lot of ways we can injure our heads or experience a brain injury. It could be in a football game - getting a concussion. I&amp;#39;ve had clients who have fallen off horses. But something that I&amp;#39;ve seen happen with an increasing frequency over the last few years would be people who are patients in a hospital doing fine recovering, but they end up having a brain injury because of the nursing and doctor care.</description></item><item><title>Video: Holiday seasons see an increase in dangerous hospital errors</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/video-holiday-seasons-see-an-increase-in-dangerous-hospital-errors/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/video-holiday-seasons-see-an-increase-in-dangerous-hospital-errors/</guid><description>With the holiday season upon us there are two things I want to talk to you about today that can keep you and your family safe when it comes to hospitalizations.
Number one, if you can avoid a hospitalization during the holiday season, you should do it as much as possible. Now what this means if you have an elective surgery&amp;mdash;meaning that something you could put off for a month or two&amp;mdash;it would be better to wait until the holiday is over.</description></item><item><title>Patients beware: Physician care at rehabilitation facilities can be sparse</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/patients-beware-physician-care-at-rehabilitation-facilities-can-be-sparse/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/patients-beware-physician-care-at-rehabilitation-facilities-can-be-sparse/</guid><description>Rehabilitation hospitals market themselves as facilities where patients can continue to receive health care after they are ready to be discharged from a regular acute care hospital, but are not quite ready to go home.
Sometimes, though, I believe patients would be better off going home. Let me explain why.
I have handled a number of medical malpractice lawsuits concerning rehabilitation hospitals like the Triumph/Kindred system and Reliant Rehabilitation. One of the common themes I see in these cases is very limited physician involvement in the care that is provided.</description></item><item><title>Holidays are a good time to avoid hospitals</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/holidays-are-a-good-time-to-avoid-hospitals/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/holidays-are-a-good-time-to-avoid-hospitals/</guid><description>Have you ever noticed that any time you or family member gets sick, it seems to happen on an evening, weekend or holiday? That certainly seems how it goes in our family. Did you know, though, that during these times the risk of medical and nursing errors in the hospital is much higher than normal?
If possible, avoid hospitals on weekends, evenings and holidays
No matter the occupation or workplace, most people enjoy taking time off from work around the holidays and during the summer.</description></item><item><title>How to spot life-threatening infections and sepsis</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-to-spot-life-threatening-infections-and-sepsis/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-to-spot-life-threatening-infections-and-sepsis/</guid><description>Infections occur when bacteria or fungi invade the human body and then start multiplying and feeding. There are many types of infections that we commonly hear about, including staph infections, MRSA infections (methicillin-resistant staph aureus), bedsores and infected catheters or lines.
It is always a serious matter when a patient has an active infection. Prompt diagnosis is important because the faster treatment begins, the more likely the infection can be killed and the patient can go on with his or her life.</description></item><item><title>Three secrets about how hospitals and doctors hide their past mistakes from the public</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/three-secrets-about-how-hospitals-and-doctors-hide-their-past-mistakes-from-the-public/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/three-secrets-about-how-hospitals-and-doctors-hide-their-past-mistakes-from-the-public/</guid><description>There is not a week that goes by when a client does not ask me &amp;ldquo;Has the doctor done this to anyone else?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Why did the hospital let the doctor practice at its facility?&amp;rdquo;
These are straightforward and understandable questions. After all, people regularly check out service providers at sites like the Better Business Bureau or Angie&amp;rsquo;s List. Yet, the medical profession is unique in that its self-policing is shrouded in secrecy.</description></item><item><title>Painter Law Firm negotiates $550,000 settlement for client in medical malpractice infection case</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/painter-law-firm-negotiates-550000-settlement-for-client-in-medical-malpractice-infection-case/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Apr 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/painter-law-firm-negotiates-550000-settlement-for-client-in-medical-malpractice-infection-case/</guid><description>Painter Law Firm represented a client who was severely injured after a surgery when a nurse missed clear signs and symptoms of an infection.
The patient was being treated at a Houston-area hospital following a lap-band surgery. When the nurse removed a catheter line from the patient&amp;rsquo;s arm, the patient saw pus squirt out and asked for the line to be cultured. The nurse did not culture the line and did not tell the doctor about the incident.</description></item><item><title>U.S. government study shows that hospitals cover up when they injure patients</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/u.s.-government-study-shows-that-hospitals-cover-up-when-they-injure-patients/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jan 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/u.s.-government-study-shows-that-hospitals-cover-up-when-they-injure-patients/</guid><description>A study released in January 2012 once again highlights the risks to patients of going to hospitals and getting injured by medical malpractice.
In particular, hospitals get a failing grade when it comes to reporting incidents that are harmful to patients. When they cover up instead of report, doctors, nurses and hospital administrators are less likely to learn from their mistakes and make changes for the good so that future patients will not be harmed.</description></item><item><title>New study shows tragic consequences of poor hospital communication</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/new-study-shows-tragic-consequences-of-poor-hospital-communication/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/new-study-shows-tragic-consequences-of-poor-hospital-communication/</guid><description>I have handled many medical malpractice cases where a gap in communication at a hospital causes a patient to get severely injured or even die.
It usually happens like this.
A doctor orders some lab work or a radiological study, like a CT scan or MRI. After the results are in, a nurse, lab tech or radiology tech does not information the physician who ordered the study. When the results are critical, this means that precious time is lost when the physician remains in the dark and cannot order life-saving treatment.</description></item><item><title>Hyponatremia after a head injury can cause brain damage or death</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/hyponatremia-after-a-head-injury-can-cause-brain-damage-or-death/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Nov 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/hyponatremia-after-a-head-injury-can-cause-brain-damage-or-death/</guid><description>Any time I hear about someone who has had a head trauma in a car wreck I find myself concerned about sodium, of all things.

I have also seen this in cases where patients had a sinus infection that spread to the brain.

Under current law, a hospital &amp;#39;ethics&amp;#39; committee can override the wishes of a patient or family for care to continue, if the committee decides that care is &amp;#39;medically futile&amp;#39;. The committee can meet with just 48 hours of notice to the patient, and if the committee finds against the patient the hospital only has to wait 10 days before terminating all curative care, nutrition and hydration.</description></item><item><title>Video: Hospital death panels in Texas</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/video-hospital-death-panels-in-texas/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jan 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/video-hospital-death-panels-in-texas/</guid><description>Learn the shocking truth about how hospitals and doctors in Texas, not patients and their families, get to make the final decision as to whether health care continues or ends--ultimately meaning that they decide whether the patient lives or dies.

Session after session, the Texas legislature has failed to amend it despite a terrible controversy over the provisions governing end-of-life care.
As it stands now, hospital committees, not patients and their families, have the ultimate say-so in whether a person receives curative care, food and water&amp;mdash;in other words, they make the &amp;#39;life and death&amp;#39; decision.
Plus, the due process provisions of the law are dubious: (1) Hospitals only need to give a patient and family 48-hours&amp;#39; notice of the committee meeting.</description></item><item><title>Instead of pointing fingers at each other, doctors and nurses need to focus on patient care and safety</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/instead-of-pointing-fingers-at-each-other-doctors-and-nurses-need-to-focus-on-patient-care-and-safety/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/instead-of-pointing-fingers-at-each-other-doctors-and-nurses-need-to-focus-on-patient-care-and-safety/</guid><description>Study after study has shown that one of the biggest contributors to medical errors and negligence is poor communication among healthcare providers. In a race, one runner does his or her part and then passes the baton to a team member for the next segment of the race. In the health care setting, the baton is frequently not passed, it is dropped.
In an effort to stop this breakdown in communication that endangers patient safety, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) requires hospitals to train nurses and physicians on &amp;lsquo;handoff communications.</description></item><item><title>Video: Robert Painter speaks about the Texas futile care (death panel) law</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/video-robert-painter-speaks-about-the-texas-futile-care-death-panel-law/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Nov 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/video-robert-painter-speaks-about-the-texas-futile-care-death-panel-law/</guid><description>Robert Painter addressed the Houston Disability Elder Law Association on the Texas &amp;#39;Futile Care&amp;#39; law on October 19, 2010 at The Downtown Club at the Met, in Houston. This article provides links to the video from that presentation as well as other resources. Many Texans are surprised to learn that the Advance Directives Act of 1999 allows a hospital committee to act as a &amp;#39;death panel&amp;#39; that can override a patient or family&amp;#39;s treatment wishes, even to the point of withholding care, treatment, food and water from a patient.</description></item><item><title>Medicare: 1 in 7 patients is harmed during hospitalization</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/medicare-1-in-7-patients-is-harmed-during-hospitalization/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/medicare-1-in-7-patients-is-harmed-during-hospitalization/</guid><description>According to a new report by the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, about 15,000 Medicare patients per month experience a complication or error while hospitalized that contributes to death.

Time and time again studies have shown that poor communications increase medical errors and patient deaths.
As a Texas medical malpractice lawyer, I frequently see cases in which doctors give orders, hospital nursing or technical staff do not complete the orders, and doctors do not check back for the results.
Without appropriate &amp;#39;hand off&amp;#39; communications (as required by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations) or follow-up by a physician, quite often the patient suffers harm.</description></item><item><title>Texas finally takes first step in regulating 'pill mills'</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-finally-takes-first-step-in-regulating-pill-mills/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Sep 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-finally-takes-first-step-in-regulating-pill-mills/</guid><description>When it comes to pain management physicians, it is not enough to find a &amp;#39;board certified&amp;#39; doctor.

At that point, a doctor can &amp;ldquo;hang a shingle&amp;rdquo; and start practicing medicine.

Hospitals credential doctors to practice in certain areas of medicine or to perform specific procedures or surgeries.</description></item><item><title>'Stat' means 'now': How hospitals bungle urgent CT and MRI orders</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/stat-means-now-how-hospitals-bungle-urgent-ct-and-mri-orders/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jul 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/stat-means-now-how-hospitals-bungle-urgent-ct-and-mri-orders/</guid><description>A doctor orders radiology studies for a patient when a physical exam suggests a preliminary diagnosis but additional information is necessary to be certain. Having the correct diagnosis is essential for selecting the correct treatment.
Frequently, a doctor orders a radiology scan, like computer aided tomography (CT or &amp;ldquo;CAT scan&amp;rdquo;) or magnetic resonance image (MRI), when he or she needs detailed information about an internal part of the body.
After the CT or MRI is ordered, a nurse or hospital administrative staff gets the order to a radiology department.</description></item><item><title>Poor nursing communication causes needless hospital injuries and deaths</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/poor-nursing-communication-causes-needless-hospital-injuries-and-deaths/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jun 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/poor-nursing-communication-causes-needless-hospital-injuries-and-deaths/</guid><description>When a patient is admitted to a hospital one of the most important factors for achieving treatment goals is competent nursing care.
Physicians perform assessments and make orders, and most often then delegate it to the nursing staff to monitor the patient, follow the orders, and report back when there are any changes in the patient&amp;rsquo;s status.
For nurses to be able to fulfill this role, hospitals must be serious about their role to hire only qualified nurses and then to use proper testing and assessment to ensure that those nurses have the skills to take care of particular types of patients.</description></item><item><title>Rising health care costs aren't because of medical malpractice claims</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/rising-health-care-costs-arent-because-of-medical-malpractice-claims/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Mar 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/rising-health-care-costs-arent-because-of-medical-malpractice-claims/</guid><description>Fewer medical malpractice payments were made on behalf of doctors in 2009 than any year on record, according to an update of the National Practitioner Data Bank that was released this week.

The balance of power between patients and physicians about end-of-life health care decisions has seesawed over the years. The development of "advance directives," led to a nationwide shift in favor of patients. Advance directives allow patients the opportunity to convey end-of-life decisions prior to a need arising. In Texas, these patient rights have diminished as legislators focus on development and implementation of the futility review process that authorizes health-care providers to have the final say under certain circumstances.</description></item><item><title>Data shows a big difference between hospital and office anesthesia safety</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/data-shows-a-big-difference-between-hospital-and-office-anesthesia-safety/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/data-shows-a-big-difference-between-hospital-and-office-anesthesia-safety/</guid><description>From a medical malpractice perspective, how can patients ensure they are receiving safe and effective anesthesia care outside of a hospital setting?</description></item></channel></rss>
