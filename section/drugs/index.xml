Fluoroquinolones are prescribed to kill infection-causing bacteria or to stop them from growing. FDA-approved drugs in this class include levofloxacin (Levaquin), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), moxifloxacin (Avelox), ofloxacin, and Gemifloxacin (Factive).
The FDA ordered safety labeling changes for these drugs because of risks that were uncovered under an FDA safety review. Research has shown an association between fluoroquinolone use, whether in oral form or by injection, and severe and sometimes permanent side effects including damage to tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and the central nervous system.</description></item></channel></rss>
