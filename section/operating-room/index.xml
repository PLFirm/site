Let&amp;#39;s refer to her as Sarah.
Sarah was a delightful lady with a grandmotherly smile that brightened everyone&amp;#39;s day. Prior to hiring our firm, she underwent abdominal surgery and was scheduled for a short stay in a skilled nursing facility (SNF) to recover and regain strength before returning home. Despite some hearing difficulties, Sarah led an independent life and was generally healthy.</description></item><item><title>Data show a big difference between hospital and office anesthesia safety</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/data-show-a-big-difference-between-hospital-and-office-anesthesia-safety/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/data-show-a-big-difference-between-hospital-and-office-anesthesia-safety/</guid><description>Today&amp;#39;s healthcare consumers have more choices than ever before. When it comes to surgeries and procedures, patients have the option of having them done in an office setting or a hospital operating room. Patients also have the option of selecting a physician anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist to provide anesthesia care, although many facilities do not present it as a choice.
Why have a procedure in an office instead of a hospital operating room?</description></item><item><title>Patient dies from nursing home fall despite documented high risk</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/patient-dies-from-nursing-home-fall-despite-documented-high-risk/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/patient-dies-from-nursing-home-fall-despite-documented-high-risk/</guid><description>A physician friend of mine recently commented on social media that, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m old enough to remember when surgeons would take patients to the OR [operating room] for appys [appendix removal surgery] or cholecystitis [gallbladder inflammation] based on the physical exam and history. I still love those old school surgeons.&amp;rdquo;
Her comment got me thinking about how old school medical care is different than what’s touted as improved care today. Some hospitals and facilities create systems that try and force physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and nurses to serve metrics and computers rather than the patients they&amp;rsquo;re supposed to be taking care of.</description></item><item><title>Man falls off operating room table at Methodist The Woodlands</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/man-falls-off-operating-room-table-at-methodist-the-woodlands/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/man-falls-off-operating-room-table-at-methodist-the-woodlands/</guid><description>According to a pending medical malpractice lawsuit in Harris County, Texas, a patient at Houston Methodist The Woodlands Hospital fell off the operating room table while under anesthesia and developed a traumatic brain injury.
This man&amp;rsquo;s unfortunate hospitalization occurred after he fell at home and broke his hip.
The next day, an orthopedic surgeon took him to the Methodist operating room for surgery to repair the fractured hip. There were no apparent problems with the technical part of surgery itself, but the lawsuit alleges that something went terribly wrong at the end.</description></item><item><title>Obstetrician, hospitalist, other physicians fail to diagnose damaged ureter, internal urine leak after hysterectomy</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/obstetrician-hospitalist-other-physicians-fail-to-diagnose-damaged-ureter-internal-urine-leak-after-hysterectomy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/obstetrician-hospitalist-other-physicians-fail-to-diagnose-damaged-ureter-internal-urine-leak-after-hysterectomy/</guid><description>One of the most common defenses used in surgical medical malpractice cases is that a complication is a known risk of the procedure. Known risks are things that can happen even when care is appropriate and no negligence was involved. Theyâ€™re usually detailed in the informed consent paperwork that patients are asked to sign before care begins.
For example, when a patient has a hysterectomy, itâ€™s a known risk that the ureter can be damaged, resulting in a leak of urine into the patientâ€™s peritoneal cavity.</description></item><item><title>Neurosurgeons face class action lawsuit alleging unnecessary spine surgeries</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/neurosurgeons-face-class-action-lawsuit-alleging-unnecessary-spine-surgeries/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/neurosurgeons-face-class-action-lawsuit-alleging-unnecessary-spine-surgeries/</guid><description>â€œIf your only toolâ€™s a hammer, then everything looks like a nail.â€
That sums up the practice approach of some surgeons, who are eager to operate on patients even when they donâ€™t need a surgery.&amp;nbsp;
One of the first questions we consider when investigating cases involving surgical errors or complications is whether the surgery was even indicated in the first place.
This is the precise issue presented in a class action lawsuit that was recently filed against two neurosurgeons.</description></item><item><title>Jury holds orthopedic surgery group accountable in compartment syndrome case</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/jury-holds-orthopedic-surgery-group-accountable-in-compartment-syndrome-case/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/jury-holds-orthopedic-surgery-group-accountable-in-compartment-syndrome-case/</guid><description>Compartment syndrome is a dreaded condition that can happen develop after a broken bone.
What is compartment syndrome?
Different areas of the body are grouped together into compartments that are walled off by fascia and connective tissue. A serious injury in the lower leg, such as a broken bone, can cause bleeding and swelling within a compartment.&amp;nbsp;
Because the connective tissue walls of compartments are relatively rigid, thereâ€™s only so much room for expansion.</description></item><item><title>Texas trauma surgeons lose at trial with the &amp;quot;blame the patient&amp;quot; defense</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-trauma-surgeons-lose-at-trial-with-the-quotblame-the-patientquot-defense/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-trauma-surgeons-lose-at-trial-with-the-quotblame-the-patientquot-defense/</guid><description>A common focus of medical malpractice defense lawyers is finding someone else to blame for what happened to a plaintiff. Frequently, the target of that blame is the patient, who, of course, is the plaintiff in the medical malpractice lawsuit.
I often get a laugh from our middle-aged or senior clients when I tell them not to be surprised by a deposition question from a lawyer for a defendant hospital or doctor about a childhood stubbed toe injury they had.</description></item><item><title>Adhesions increase the risk of abdominal or pelvic surgery</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/adhesions-increase-the-risk-of-abdominal-or-pelvic-surgery/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/adhesions-increase-the-risk-of-abdominal-or-pelvic-surgery/</guid><description>Our firm has handled several Texas medical malpractice cases where patients had abdominal or pelvic surgery that went amuck because of a surgeonâ€™s poor handling of adhesions.
Adhesions are connective tissue formations that connect structures that are normally separate and unconnected. They can form because of trauma to the abdomen and pelvis, but more frequently form in the natural process of healing after surgery. Different medical studies have reported the presence of adhesions in between 20â€“93% of surgical patients.</description></item><item><title>Jury awards $12 million in esophageal intubation case</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/jury-awards-12-million-in-esophageal-intubation-case/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/jury-awards-12-million-in-esophageal-intubation-case/</guid><description>Medical and health professionals often use intubation to secure the patientâ€™s airway. This involves inserting a flexible endotracheal tube down the patientâ€™s throat into the trachea, or airway.
In some situations, and anesthesiologist or certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA) will intubate a patient as part of administration of general anesthesia for surgery. This is typically done in a planned, controlled environment.&amp;nbsp;
In these circumstances, the standard of care requires a pre-anesthesia assessment, which includes planning for proper management of patients with difficult airways.</description></item><item><title>Post-operative infections, sepsis can trigger a stroke</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/post-operative-infections-sepsis-can-trigger-a-stroke/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/post-operative-infections-sepsis-can-trigger-a-stroke/</guid><description>A woman in her 50s went to a hospital to have a bariatric conversion procedure.&amp;nbsp;
Over a decade earlier, she had a lap band procedure, but had recently started having problems with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. After consulting with her bariatric surgeon, she decided to have her lap band removed and convert over to a gastric bypass.
Unfortunately, during the conversion surgery, the surgeon perforated part of her bowel and didnâ€™t recognize it.</description></item><item><title>See what the El Paso Court of Appeals has to say about an OB/GYN surgeon not doing a surgery he charged for, leaving the patient in the dark</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/see-what-the-el-paso-court-of-appeals-has-to-say-about-an-ob/gyn-surgeon-not-doing-a-surgery-he-charged-for-leaving-the-patient-in-the-dark/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/see-what-the-el-paso-court-of-appeals-has-to-say-about-an-ob/gyn-surgeon-not-doing-a-surgery-he-charged-for-leaving-the-patient-in-the-dark/</guid><description>The El Paso Court of Appeals recently issued an interesting opinion in a summary judgment case arising from allegations that an OB/GYN physician failed to perform a surgery for which he billed the collected money from the patient.

What are the basics of laparoscopic surgery?
Unlike conventional open-approach abdominal surgeries that require one or more large incisions, the hallmark of laparoscopic surgery is small incisions. The small incisions are why laparoscopic surgeries are often described as being minimally invasive.
In all abdominal laparoscopic procedures, there is a primary incision of around one-half an inch near the belly button.</description></item><item><title>Patient suffers cut esophagus during hiatal hernia surgery</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/patient-suffers-cut-esophagus-during-hiatal-hernia-surgery/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/patient-suffers-cut-esophagus-during-hiatal-hernia-surgery/</guid><description>The Texarkana Court of Appeals entered an opinion in a case dealing with the situation of a patient having concerning clinical signs, but a radiology scan or other testing shows no abnormalities.
In my experience, many patients are frustrated in the circumstances and feel that their doctors and healthcare providers are more interested in what a computer screen says that the patient sitting in front of them.
In the Texarkana case, the care at issue started with a rather routine laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair and endoscopy.</description></item><item><title>Surgical retractor moves during brain surgery, causes devastating brainstem injury</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surgical-retractor-moves-during-brain-surgery-causes-devastating-brainstem-injury/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surgical-retractor-moves-during-brain-surgery-causes-devastating-brainstem-injury/</guid><description>The Corpus Christi&amp;mdash;Edinburg Court of Appeals entered an opinion addressing a common issue in operating room surgical medical malpractice cases.

One challenge is that when patients are placed under general anesthesia, they have no idea what&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp; happened in their care until they wake up, usually in the recovery room.
For instance, patients might think they know the answers to these questions before being wheeled off to the OR, but could be wrong:</description></item><item><title>U.S. government joins civil lawsuit over hospital and surgeon's operating room safety issues</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/u.s.-government-joins-civil-lawsuit-over-hospital-and-surgeons-operating-room-safety-issues/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/u.s.-government-joins-civil-lawsuit-over-hospital-and-surgeons-operating-room-safety-issues/</guid><description>The United States government recently intervened in a federal court lawsuit pending in the Pennsylvania Western District since 2019 against a major medical school and its cardiothoracic surgery department chairman.

From mechanics to plumbers, from teachers to preachers, the thought &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen this 100 times&amp;rdquo; has to run through their mind.
Some medical malpractice claims are no different. For instance, there&amp;rsquo;s a common theme that I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed in cases involving unintentionally retained surgical items, specifically sponges.
When a foreign object is left inside a patient, it essentially becomes a magnet for infection and can wreak havoc across the entire body.</description></item><item><title>Esophageal perforation management and medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/esophageal-perforation-management-and-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/esophageal-perforation-management-and-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>Esophageal perforation is a dreaded rare complication of surgeries and procedures involving the neck.
What is the esophagus?
The esophagus is a muscular tube for the transport of food and liquids from the throat to the gastrointestinal tract. It&amp;rsquo;s located anterior (in front of) the spinal column and posterior (behind) the trachea, or windpipe.
How can the esophagus get perforated in the operating room?
Medical studies report that esophageal perforation has occurred in procedures including anterior cervical spine surgery, endoscopy (placement of a flexible scope with camera down the throat), and during intubation or extubation (placing or removing, respectively, an endotracheal tube down the throat for general anesthesia).</description></item><item><title>Closed claims show common bariatric/weight loss surgery medical malpractice trends</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/closed-claims-show-common-bariatric/weight-loss-surgery-medical-malpractice-trends/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/closed-claims-show-common-bariatric/weight-loss-surgery-medical-malpractice-trends/</guid><description>A closed claims study identified the most common themes in bariatric medical malpractice cases.
Studies like this remind me of the old saying about how experience teaches.
In health care, experience is certainly important. This includes learning from mistakes. That&amp;rsquo;s why when there are certain bad outcomes&amp;mdash;sentinel events&amp;mdash;accreditation standards and the standard of care require a root cause analysis. The idea is to figure out why health care mistakes happen and to incorporate training to prevent them from being repeated.</description></item><item><title>Wrong patient taken to kidney transplant surgery</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/wrong-patient-taken-to-kidney-transplant-surgery/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/wrong-patient-taken-to-kidney-transplant-surgery/</guid><description>Although in my practice as a Texas medical malpractice attorney, I regularly encounter wrong-site, wrong-patient surgical cases, every now and then something comes up that is just astounding.

The most common problem that we hear about from potential clients calling Painter Law Firm is the unintended injury of the nearby organ during surgery. The most common of these iatrogenic (healthcare-acquired) injuries are lacerated or torn bowel, stomach, liver, or spleen. These injuries are more difficult to spot during surgery because the surgeon is working with equipment and a camera inserted through small incisions in the abdomen.</description></item><item><title>The dangers of oversedation for pain management, other office surgical procedures</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-dangers-of-oversedation-for-pain-management-other-office-surgical-procedures/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-dangers-of-oversedation-for-pain-management-other-office-surgical-procedures/</guid><description>Recent medical research and malpractice claims history have shown that unnecessary use of sedation and oversedation have become serious problems for the safety of surgical patients.

As a former hospital administrator, I know that sentinel events (also called never events) are a big deal. Accrediting agencies require hospital leaders to investigate sentinel events using a process called a root cause analysis. The idea is that this deep dive will identify what led to the serious health care error and what changes to policies, procedures, and education can prevent it from injuring other patients in the future.</description></item><item><title>What can the trial court consider at a Chapter 74 preliminary expert report hearing in a Texas medical malpractice case?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-can-the-trial-court-consider-at-a-chapter-74-preliminary-expert-report-hearing-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-case/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-can-the-trial-court-consider-at-a-chapter-74-preliminary-expert-report-hearing-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-case/</guid><description>Texas law requires medical malpractice plaintiffs to produce one or more medical expert reports within 120 days of each defendant filing an answer and a lawsuit.

Beyond these concerns, though, the most common type of sleep apnea, called obstructive sleep apnea, is a serious and potentially life-threatening medical condition.
Obstructive sleep apnea is a medical condition where the muscles of the throat and soft palate intermittently relax during sleep. When this happens, those anatomical structures drop and partially or fully obstruct the airway.</description></item><item><title>When does the willful and wanton standard of proof apply in Texas ER medical malpractice cases?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/when-does-the-willful-and-wanton-standard-of-proof-apply-in-texas-er-medical-malpractice-cases/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/when-does-the-willful-and-wanton-standard-of-proof-apply-in-texas-er-medical-malpractice-cases/</guid><description>Texas law treats medical malpractice lawsuits differently from other types of negligence cases. One of the significant differences is a heightened standard of proof in some types of claims.
Texas Civil Practice &amp;amp; Remedies Code Section 74.153 mandates a standard of proof called “willful and wanton negligence” for certain emergency medical care cases. If you’re confused by what that means, join the club.

In other situations, though, the problem may be hidden. I&amp;rsquo;m not referencing a surgeon, doctor, or nurse hiding a complication or error, although that sometimes happens. Rather, I&amp;rsquo;m talking about a serious mistake that no one knows about for months or even years.</description></item><item><title>Operating room and surgical fire medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/operating-room-and-surgical-fire-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/operating-room-and-surgical-fire-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>Of all the things you&amp;rsquo;d think might happen in an operating room (OR), a patient catching on fire is probably near the bottom of the list.

These days, anesthesia is so common that it&amp;rsquo;s hard to imagine even getting a tooth filled without it.

Surgeons often describe the benefits of these procedures to include leaving fewer scars, being less invasive, having a faster recovery time, and reducing postoperative pain.
Laparoscopic techniques are recommended and preferred by most surgeons for a variety of surgeries including weight loss/bariatric procedures, gallbladder removal (cholecystectomy), abdominal hernia repairs, appendix removal (appendectomy), and even female sterilization.
From my experience as a Houston, Texas medical malpractice attorney, I believe that some surgeons leave out the risks when discussing these modern techniques.</description></item><item><title>Surgeons admit under oath to operating on wrong kidney</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surgeons-admit-under-oath-to-operating-on-wrong-kidney/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surgeons-admit-under-oath-to-operating-on-wrong-kidney/</guid><description>A few months ago, I wrote an article about a Tennessee surgeon who took a patient to surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and operated on the wrong kidney.

The idea behind cardiac clearance is to assess a patient&amp;rsquo;s risk of a cardiovascular event occurring during the surgery and what interventions and plans can be made to manage them. If a serious heart condition is uncovered, the elective surgery will be delayed or canceled so the life-threatening cardiac issues can be addressed.</description></item><item><title>Surgical team operates on wrong knee</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surgical-team-operates-on-wrong-knee/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surgical-team-operates-on-wrong-knee/</guid><description>It happened again.

Why weight loss surgery is popular
I guess it should not be surprising that bariatric surgery has become rather popular. Statistics show that around 35% of U.S. adults are obese and over 67% are overweight or obese. To make matters worse, as we age, it is harder to lose and keep weight off because of a significant decrease in the number of calories we burn (called the basal metabolic rate).</description></item><item><title>For surgical nerve injuries, waiting for them to heal on their own can be dangerous</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/for-surgical-nerve-injuries-waiting-for-them-to-heal-on-their-own-can-be-dangerous/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/for-surgical-nerve-injuries-waiting-for-them-to-heal-on-their-own-can-be-dangerous/</guid><description>A patient recently called our office about a nerve injury that happened during a hernia repair surgery at a hospital in Houston&amp;#39;s Texas Medical Center.

Surgical site infections are those that develop at the location of an incision, cut, or puncture of the skin and underlying tissue&amp;nbsp;made during the surgery.
Types of surgical site infections
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) describes three different types of surgical site infections. The first, a superficial incisional infection, is limited to the area of the skin where an incision was made.</description></item><item><title>Bariatric weight-loss surgery benefits, risks, and medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/bariatric-weight-loss-surgery-benefits-risks-and-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/bariatric-weight-loss-surgery-benefits-risks-and-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>As bariatric weight-loss procedures have become increasingly popular, I have handled more and more bariatric surgery cases in my law practice as a Houston, Texas medical malpractice attorney.

A hematoma is a solid collection of clotted blood. Hematoma sometimes form following a spinal surgery, and orthopedic and neurosurgical experts often refer to them as a compressive lesion.

In Texas, we have a strange legal doctrine called the Corporate Practice of Medicine Act, which basically means that doctors cannot be hospital employees.</description></item><item><title>Surgical checklists increase patient safety</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surgical-checklists-increase-patient-safety/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surgical-checklists-increase-patient-safety/</guid><description>When people consent to have a surgery, they do so because it will likely fix a problem or sickness that they are experiencing.
Even though every surgery carries certain risks, few people expect that they will be ones to experience a new illness, complication, or even death from the procedure. Some of these potential complications are unavoidable risks of surgery, but others can be avoided if the surgeons, nurses, and operating room team pay a little more attention.</description></item><item><title>Three things that you can do to reduce the serious risks of anesthesia</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/three-things-that-you-can-do-to-reduce-the-serious-risks-of-anesthesia/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/three-things-that-you-can-do-to-reduce-the-serious-risks-of-anesthesia/</guid><description>Whether it is given in a hospital operating room, doctor&amp;rsquo;s office, or dentist&amp;rsquo;s office, general anesthesia presents serious risks. As a Texas medical malpractice lawyer, I frequently get called by patients and families who have been seriously injured, or worse, as a result an anesthesia mishap.
Just recently, a family called about the tragic death of a husband and father. It all started with a bout of food poisoning that was so bad that it caused blood clots to form in both of his legs.</description></item><item><title>What happens when plastic surgery goes wrong?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-happens-when-plastic-surgery-goes-wrong/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-happens-when-plastic-surgery-goes-wrong/</guid><description>As a Houston medical malpractice lawyer, people reach out to me just about every day for help after something went terribly wrong in their health care.

According to the lawsuit, Angelo had a surgery about three weeks before his death, but the surgeon did not prescribe blood thinners or physical therapy. Angelo died at home, at the age of 51, from a massive pulmonary embolism.
As an experienced Texas medical malpractice lawyer, I have handled similar cases, where people have developed blood clots and died on the operating room table, or within a short time after surgery, from pulmonary embolism.</description></item><item><title>Surgeons with bad attitudes get bad results more often for their patients</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surgeons-with-bad-attitudes-get-bad-results-more-often-for-their-patients/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surgeons-with-bad-attitudes-get-bad-results-more-often-for-their-patients/</guid><description>According to a February 2017 study in the medical journal JAMA Surgery, surgeons who are rude to patients and family members have unusually high rates for infections and surgery complications.
The authors got the idea to do the study because when patients complain about a surgeon, there is a higher likelihood of a medical malpractice claim. The authors wanted to explore whether the same behavior of a surgeon that causes a strained relationship with his or her patients also leads to medical errors and malpractice.</description></item><item><title>Three tips to avoid hernia repair surgery problems</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/three-tips-to-avoid-hernia-repair-surgery-problems/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/three-tips-to-avoid-hernia-repair-surgery-problems/</guid><description>In my career as a Texas medical malpractice lawyer, I have represented many clients who had a hernia and then experienced additional suffering when a surgeon messed up the hernia repair surgery.
What is a hernia?

Before any type of surgery, the surgeon or nurse will go over a consent form with the patient, including an area that deals with the risk of infection.</description></item><item><title>Six tips to protect yourself before surgery</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/six-tips-to-protect-yourself-before-surgery/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/six-tips-to-protect-yourself-before-surgery/</guid><description>As a Houston medical malpractice lawyer, I have handled hundreds of cases where surgeons or anesthesiologists botch a surgery or procedure and cause a serious injury or death.

In many hospitals around Texas, informed consent is treated as a check-the-box exercise with little thought or discussion.</description></item><item><title>Memorial Hermann Southeast Hospital anesthesia team overdoses Propofol, causing death of 45-year-old woman</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/memorial-hermann-southeast-hospital-anesthesia-team-overdoses-propofol-causing-death-of-45-year-old-woman/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Mar 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/memorial-hermann-southeast-hospital-anesthesia-team-overdoses-propofol-causing-death-of-45-year-old-woman/</guid><description>Attorney Robert Painter&amp;nbsp;filed a wrongful death medical malpractice lawsuit against Memorial Hermann Southeast Hospital, and an anesthesiologist and certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA) who work at the hospital, concerning the needless death of 45-year-old Michelle Hunt.

Bariatric surgery is a field that is still rapidly developing and includes numerous procedures including lap-band, gastric sleeve, plication, bypass and imbrication. Generally speaking, bariatric procedures may help people suffering from obesity by decreasing the volume that the stomach can hold.
One of the known risks of any bariatric surgery is gastric outlet obstruction. This is a pretty easy concept to understand.</description></item><item><title>Surgical errors can be reduced with a simple checklist</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surgical-errors-can-be-reduced-with-a-simple-checklist/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Oct 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surgical-errors-can-be-reduced-with-a-simple-checklist/</guid><description>Unfortunately many hospitals, nurses and physicians have poor communication practices.
