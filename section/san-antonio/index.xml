I still love those old school surgeons.&amp;rdquo;
Her comment got me thinking about how old school medical care is different than whatâ€™s touted as improved care today.

The man went to see his primary care provider because of ear pain that radiated down into his jaw. Strangely, the physician did not examine or look into the patient&amp;rsquo;s ear but instead quickly concluded that he had arthritis.
Over the course of the next two months, the pain did not resolve so he returned to the primary care clinic on two more occasions.</description></item></channel></rss>
