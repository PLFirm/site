Medicare releases an annual list of star ratings for hospitals nationwide. It&amp;rsquo;s a results and data-focused program that reminds me of the saying &amp;ldquo;if it isn&amp;rsquo;t measured, it isn&amp;rsquo;t done.&amp;rdquo;
How does Medicare rank hospitals?
The Medicare program ranks hospitals based on their performance in five areas. The bottom-performing hospitals nationwide, based on these measures, are given 1-star ratings.</description></item><item><title>Houston's United Memorial Medical Center slapped with immediate jeopardy violation by Medicare</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/houstons-united-memorial-medical-center-slapped-with-immediate-jeopardy-violation-by-medicare/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/houstons-united-memorial-medical-center-slapped-with-immediate-jeopardy-violation-by-medicare/</guid><description>Part of the federal funding of hospital and nursing home care through the Medicare and Medicaid programs comes with periodic site visits by surveyors. When a surveyor finds an extremely dangerous condition, &amp;nbsp;there can be prompt consequences.
Immediate jeopardy is when the surveyor finds that the hospital facility hasn&amp;rsquo;t complied with one or more requirements of Medicare participation, and feels that the noncompliance has caused or is likely to cause serious injury, harm, impairment, or death to a patient or resident.</description></item><item><title>Without assessment and prevention, it doesn't take long for a hospitalized patient to get a pressure wound</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/without-assessment-and-prevention-it-doesnt-take-long-for-a-hospitalized-patient-to-get-a-pressure-wound/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/without-assessment-and-prevention-it-doesnt-take-long-for-a-hospitalized-patient-to-get-a-pressure-wound/</guid><description>Patients go to the hospital for medical help, not to get a new injury. Hospital or healthcare-acquired injuries are so common, though, that there&amp;rsquo;s a special term to describe them&amp;mdash;iatrogenic injuries.
One of the most common types of iatrogenic injury is pressure injuries. This dreaded condition goes by other names, including decubitus ulcers, pressure sores, and bedsores. These injuries are often avoidable and cause a significant amount of pain and treatment, and even death.</description></item><item><title>Lawsuit alleges patient discharged from HCA Houston Healthcare Kingwood emergency room with spinal cord injury</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/lawsuit-alleges-patient-discharged-from-hca-houston-healthcare-kingwood-emergency-room-with-spinal-cord-injury/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/lawsuit-alleges-patient-discharged-from-hca-houston-healthcare-kingwood-emergency-room-with-spinal-cord-injury/</guid><description>One of the most frustrating experiences for patients is to be sent home from the hospital without being treated for what brought them there in the first place.

Credentialing, peer review, and hospital committee privileges shield hospitals from having to divulge information showing patterns of dangerous care and bad outcomes, even in litigation.

One of the significant differences is a heightened standard of proof in some types of claims.
Texas Civil Practice &amp;amp; Remedies Code Section 74.153 mandates a standard of proof called “willful and wanton negligence” for certain emergency medical care cases. If you’re confused by what that means, join the club. Willful conduct is inconsistent with any theory of negligence, but that discussion is for another day.</description></item><item><title>United Memorial Medical Center and Houston medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/united-memorial-medical-center-and-houston-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/united-memorial-medical-center-and-houston-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>United Memorial Medical Center is the latest hospital operating out of the building located at 510 West Tidwell Road, in Houston, Texas 77091.

The reason for this is if something goes wrong, outpatient facilities don&amp;rsquo;t have the emergency equipment, supplies, and personnel on hand that hospitals do.
In fact, in case after case that I&amp;rsquo;ve handled involving an outpatient facility or surgery center, the first thing they do when there&amp;rsquo;s a problem is call 911 to get the patient to a hospital immediately.</description></item><item><title>Barebone nurse staffing levels cause medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/barebone-nurse-staffing-levels-cause-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/barebone-nurse-staffing-levels-cause-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>I recently took the deposition of a registered nurse with over 25 years of experience at a major hospital in Houston&amp;rsquo;s Texas Medical Center.

Memorial Hermann Health System is the largest non-profit health conglomeration in southeast Texas. This massive system includes 16 hospitals, eight cancer centers, three institutes for heart and vascular care, 27 sports medicine and rehabilitation centers, and many other outpatient centers.
When a patient is severely injured or dies because of questionable care in a Houston hospital, it&amp;rsquo;s important to immediately hire a top-rated Houston, Texas attorney with significant experience in handling medical malpractice cases.</description></item><item><title>Houston appellate court &amp;quot;SLAPPS&amp;quot; down North Cypress Medical Center</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/houston-appellate-court-quotslappsquot-down-north-cypress-medical-center/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/houston-appellate-court-quotslappsquot-down-north-cypress-medical-center/</guid><description>As a Houston, Texas medical malpractice attorney, I&amp;rsquo;ve handled multiple cases where the health care provided at North Cypress Medical Center is at issue.

I&amp;rsquo;m certainly not afraid to file a lawsuit against this hospital when a patient&amp;rsquo;s serious injury or death is related to this hospital&amp;rsquo;s negligence.

Many surgeons were taught that a precise surgical cut would heal better than a natural tear that might happen as the baby passes through the birth canal.
The standard of care has changed, though, and now discourages OB/GYN doctors from routinely performing episiotomies. Mounting evidence shows that the painful procedure often causes more trouble than benefits for women.</description></item><item><title>Compare birth-related complication rates of 18 Houston hospitals</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/compare-birth-related-complication-rates-of-18-houston-hospitals/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/compare-birth-related-complication-rates-of-18-houston-hospitals/</guid><description>Hospitals usually like to keep the public in the dark about bad outcomes, complications, or problems that occur.
