Here at Painter Law Firm, we frequently hear from potential clients who have faced many months of costly, invasive, and painful medical, antibiotic, and surgical care because of post-operative infections. Under Texas law, the existence of these nasty infections doesn&amp;rsquo;t always mean there was medical malpractice.
To understand the difference, we should first delve into the two essential parts of a medical malpractice claim: standard of care and causation.</description></item><item><title>ER nurse practitioner discharges patient with undiagnosed spinal epidural abscess</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/er-nurse-practitioner-discharges-patient-with-undiagnosed-spinal-epidural-abscess/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/er-nurse-practitioner-discharges-patient-with-undiagnosed-spinal-epidural-abscess/</guid><description>aA man in his 40s went to a Texas hospital emergency department (ER) because of a persistent headache, sore throat, and neck pain.

What is sepsis?
Some people describe sepsis as a massive infection, but that&amp;rsquo;s not exactly accurate. It&amp;rsquo;s actually a massive system-wide inflammatory response to an infection. It&amp;rsquo;s such a dangerous medical condition that healthcare leaders created an international awareness program called the Surviving Sepsis Campaign.</description></item><item><title>Texas trauma surgeons lose at trial with the &amp;quot;blame the patient&amp;quot; defense</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-trauma-surgeons-lose-at-trial-with-the-quotblame-the-patientquot-defense/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-trauma-surgeons-lose-at-trial-with-the-quotblame-the-patientquot-defense/</guid><description>A common focus of medical malpractice defense lawyers is finding someone else to blame for what happened to a plaintiff.

Thatâ€™s the question one of our clients asked a registered nurse when she woke up from a surgery and felt an object on the left side of her abdomen.&amp;nbsp;
â€œItâ€™s a colostomy bag,â€ the nurse replied. That sentence must have been one of the worst ones that this woman had ever heard.&amp;nbsp;

A severe headache, though, can be a sign of a life-threatening medical condition. It&amp;rsquo;s the obligation of emergency room doctors, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and registered nurses to be able to recognize a headache that&amp;rsquo;s potentially dangerous.

Even something as deplorable as sepsis has its designated time in the spotlight&amp;mdash;September is Sepsis Awareness Month.
From my perspective as a Houston, Texas medical malpractice attorney, I have no doubt that sepsis needs more awareness, both in hospitals and among the general public.

One of the significant differences is a heightened standard of proof in some types of claims.
Texas Civil Practice &amp;amp; Remedies Code Section 74.153 mandates a standard of proof called “willful and wanton negligence” for certain emergency medical care cases. If you’re confused by what that means, join the club. Willful conduct is inconsistent with any theory of negligence, but that discussion is for another day.</description></item><item><title>Meningococcemia signs, symptoms, and medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/meningococcemia-signs-symptoms-and-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/meningococcemia-signs-symptoms-and-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>Bacterial meningitis is a dreaded disease that&amp;rsquo;s caused when bacteria called Neisseria meningitidis infects the protective covering of the brain and spinal cord, called meninges. The bacteria are often spread through food. Fast diagnosis and treatment are keys to survival. Texans may remember a meningitis outbreak related to a popular ice cream brand several years ago.
A lesser-known cousin of bacterial meningitis is meningococcemia. It&amp;rsquo;s caused by the same bacteria but doesn&amp;rsquo;t spread to the brain and spinal cord meninges, but instead colonizes and thrives in the bloodstream.</description></item><item><title>Podiatrists, wound care, and medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/podiatrists-wound-care-and-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/podiatrists-wound-care-and-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>From our experience in speaking with countless patients, we believe that many surgeons who do a good job in the operating room leave much to be desired in post-operative care.

Many people think of sepsis as a bad infection, but that&amp;rsquo;s not exactly the case. When a person has a persistent infection, the body&amp;rsquo;s natural defense mechanisms can lead to a systemic inflammatory process&amp;mdash;that&amp;rsquo;s sepsis.
Sepsis is such a healthcare menace that, in 2002, medical experts and leaders throughout the world kicked off the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, which has become the standard of care for prompt diagnosis and treatment of sepsis.</description></item><item><title>The challenges of diagnosing a spinal epidural abscess</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-challenges-of-diagnosing-a-spinal-epidural-abscess/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-challenges-of-diagnosing-a-spinal-epidural-abscess/</guid><description>Spinal epidural abscess is a dangerous condition where an infection develops close to the spinal cord, causing a buildup of pus that becomes walled off, eventually compressing the spinal cord. It&amp;rsquo;s a rather rare condition that&amp;rsquo;s recently been reported to account for up to 5 out of every 10,000 hospital admissions each year in the United States.

It&amp;rsquo;s a dangerous illness that can cause life-threatening organ damage if it&amp;rsquo;s not diagnosed and treated promptly.
Sepsis is such a common problem that medical experts across the globe got together to form a research and education program called the Surviving Sepsis Campaign.

Did you realize, though, that sepsis can cause encephalopathy, which is a brain disorder?
What is sepsis?
Before talking about encephalopathy, let&amp;rsquo;s briefly go over what sepsis is and is not.
Sepsis itself isn&amp;rsquo;t an infection. Rather, sepsis occurs when a person&amp;rsquo;s immune response to a severe infection causes out-of-control inflammation throughout the body, instead of just the area affected by the infection.</description></item><item><title>Pneumonia signs, symptoms, diagnosis, and medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/pneumonia-signs-symptoms-diagnosis-and-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/pneumonia-signs-symptoms-diagnosis-and-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>Pneumonia is a type of respiratory infection that can affect one or both lungs. It&amp;rsquo;s a dangerous condition that accounts for around one million hospital admissions each year and another 140,000 readmissions after initial treatment.
Some types of infections are linked to only one type of organism, but pneumonia can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. Regardless of the culprit, though, pneumonia leads to serious respiratory problems by clogging the lungs&amp;rsquo; tiny air sacs, called alveoli, with puss or fluid.</description></item><item><title>Necrosis is a dangerous potential complication of plastic or cosmetic surgery, and there's limited time to address it</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/necrosis-is-a-dangerous-potential-complication-of-plastic-or-cosmetic-surgery-and-theres-limited-time-to-address-it/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/necrosis-is-a-dangerous-potential-complication-of-plastic-or-cosmetic-surgery-and-theres-limited-time-to-address-it/</guid><description>In my experience as a Houston, Texas medical malpractice lawyer, plastic and cosmetic surgery cases have some special considerations.
Unlike most other areas of medicine, the results of these elective procedures are often inherently subjective. In other words, the patient may have certain appearance-enhancing ideas in mind that the surgeon can claim, after the fact, were impossible, impractical, or certainly not the standard of care.
On the topic of the standard of care, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons is, in my view, notorious for refusing to even define standards of care applicable to plastic and cosmetic surgeons.</description></item><item><title>The three most common types of misdiagnosis</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-three-most-common-types-of-misdiagnosis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-three-most-common-types-of-misdiagnosis/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s frustrating to go to the doctor, urgent care, emergency room, or hospital with concerning symptoms only to be sent home after being told that nothing&amp;rsquo;s wrong.

It&amp;#39;s important for patients and physicians to follow-up and keep a close eye on any problems that continue or develop after surgery, including watery drainage.
Sinusitis can be a risky condition
I think most people don&amp;rsquo;t get too concerned about sinusitis or sinus infections.</description></item><item><title>Painter Law Firm files medical malpractice lawsuit against Houston &amp; The Woodlands plastic surgeon</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/painter-law-firm-files-medical-malpractice-lawsuit-against-houston-the-woodlands-plastic-surgeon/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/painter-law-firm-files-medical-malpractice-lawsuit-against-houston-the-woodlands-plastic-surgeon/</guid><description>Painter Law Firm filed a medical malpractice lawsuit yesterday over the post-operative care in a breast reduction surgery against a plastic surgeon who practices in Houston and The Woodlands.&amp;nbsp;Harris County District Clerk assigned the case cause number 2019-27862, in the 152nd District Court, where The Hon.

The problem of patients developing infections or other injuries simply because of being treated in a hospital has become commonplace. It has become so widespread, in fact, that there is now a name for it: hospital-acquired injuries.
Hospital-acquired infections
In my practice as a Houston, Texas medical malpractice lawyer, one of the most common hospital-acquired injuries is infections. Sometimes a delay in diagnosing and treating these infections allows them to develop into deadly sepsis.</description></item><item><title>Bacterial meningitis medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/bacterial-meningitis-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/bacterial-meningitis-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>As a Houston, Texas medical malpractice lawyer, I have represented many clients who went to the doctor or hospital several times with the same medical problem, only to be turned away. In my experience, this often happens when a doctor, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner rushes to a conclusion, rather than doing a full workup of all possible causes of the condition or illness.
A case involving a baby boy shows how dangerous this poor practice of healthcare can be to patient safety.</description></item><item><title>Surgeon ignores red, swollen, oozing knee surgery site, causes dangerous sepsis</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surgeon-ignores-red-swollen-oozing-knee-surgery-site-causes-dangerous-sepsis/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surgeon-ignores-red-swollen-oozing-knee-surgery-site-causes-dangerous-sepsis/</guid><description>As a Houston, Texas medical malpractice attorney, I handle all kinds of medical error and negligence cases both in the Houston area and all over the State of Texas.

Why weight loss surgery is popular
I guess it should not be surprising that bariatric surgery has become rather popular. Statistics show that around 35% of U.S. adults are obese and over 67% are overweight or obese. To make matters worse, as we age, it is harder to lose and keep weight off because of a significant decrease in the number of calories we burn (called the basal metabolic rate).</description></item><item><title>New guidelines for surgical site infection prevention</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/new-guidelines-for-surgical-site-infection-prevention/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/new-guidelines-for-surgical-site-infection-prevention/</guid><description>As a Houston, Texas medical malpractice lawyer, patients and family members frequently hire me to investigate health concerns that began with surgical site infections.
Surgical site infections are those that develop at the location of an incision, cut, or puncture of the skin and underlying tissue&amp;nbsp;made during the surgery.
Types of surgical site infections
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) describes three different types of surgical site infections.
