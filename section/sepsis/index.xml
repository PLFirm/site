What is sepsis?
Some people describe sepsis as a massive infection, but that&amp;rsquo;s not exactly accurate. It&amp;rsquo;s actually a massive system-wide inflammatory response to an infection. It&amp;rsquo;s such a dangerous medical condition that healthcare leaders created an international awareness program called the Surviving Sepsis Campaign.</description></item><item><title>Bariatric surgery malpractice can leave patients with permanent colostomy</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/bariatric-surgery-malpractice-can-leave-patients-with-permanent-colostomy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/bariatric-surgery-malpractice-can-leave-patients-with-permanent-colostomy/</guid><description>â€œWhatâ€™s this?â€&amp;nbsp;
Thatâ€™s the question one of our clients asked a registered nurse when she woke up from a surgery and felt an object on the left side of her abdomen.&amp;nbsp;
â€œItâ€™s a colostomy bag,â€ the nurse replied. That sentence must have been one of the worst ones that this woman had ever heard.&amp;nbsp;
â€œWhyâ€™s it there?â€ the patient continued. The nurse explained that the surgeon encountered some problems during surgery and had to cut out most of her bowels.</description></item><item><title>Post-operative infections, sepsis can trigger a stroke</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/post-operative-infections-sepsis-can-trigger-a-stroke/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/post-operative-infections-sepsis-can-trigger-a-stroke/</guid><description>A woman in her 50s went to a hospital to have a bariatric conversion procedure.&amp;nbsp;

Many people think of sepsis as a bad infection, but that&amp;rsquo;s not exactly the case. When a person has a persistent infection, the body&amp;rsquo;s natural defense mechanisms can lead to a systemic inflammatory process&amp;mdash;that&amp;rsquo;s sepsis.
Sepsis is such a healthcare menace that, in 2002, medical experts and leaders throughout the world kicked off the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, which has become the standard of care for prompt diagnosis and treatment of sepsis.</description></item><item><title>What needs to happen when doctors and nurses suspect sepsis</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-needs-to-happen-when-doctors-and-nurses-suspect-sepsis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-needs-to-happen-when-doctors-and-nurses-suspect-sepsis/</guid><description>Sepsis is an inflammatory condition caused when the body&amp;rsquo;s response to an infection gets out of control.

What is sepsis?
Before talking about encephalopathy, let&amp;rsquo;s briefly go over what sepsis is and is not.
Sepsis itself isn&amp;rsquo;t an infection. Rather, sepsis occurs when a person&amp;rsquo;s immune response to a severe infection causes out-of-control inflammation throughout the body, instead of just the area affected by the infection.</description></item><item><title>The three most common types of misdiagnosis</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-three-most-common-types-of-misdiagnosis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-three-most-common-types-of-misdiagnosis/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s frustrating to go to the doctor, urgent care, emergency room, or hospital with concerning symptoms only to be sent home after being told that nothing&amp;rsquo;s wrong.

The problem of patients developing infections or other injuries simply because of being treated in a hospital has become commonplace. It has become so widespread, in fact, that there is now a name for it: hospital-acquired injuries.
Hospital-acquired infections
In my practice as a Houston, Texas medical malpractice lawyer, one of the most common hospital-acquired injuries is infections. Sometimes a delay in diagnosing and treating these infections allows them to develop into deadly sepsis.</description></item><item><title>Surgeon ignores red, swollen, oozing knee surgery site, causes dangerous sepsis</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surgeon-ignores-red-swollen-oozing-knee-surgery-site-causes-dangerous-sepsis/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surgeon-ignores-red-swollen-oozing-knee-surgery-site-causes-dangerous-sepsis/</guid><description>As a Houston, Texas medical malpractice attorney, I handle all kinds of medical error and negligence cases both in the Houston area and all over the State of Texas.
Recently, I have been working on a number of cases involving misdiagnosed infections. From my experience in handling many infection cases, it is clear that prompt diagnosis and treatment are the keys to avoiding long-term problems. One of my clients comes to mind immediately as a good example of this.</description></item><item><title>Bariatric/weight loss surgery malpractice and malnutrition</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/bariatric/weight-loss-surgery-malpractice-and-malnutrition/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/bariatric/weight-loss-surgery-malpractice-and-malnutrition/</guid><description>In my law practice as a Houston, Texas medical malpractice attorney, I have handled a lot of cases involving bariatric/weight loss surgery.
Why weight loss surgery is popular
I guess it should not be surprising that bariatric surgery has become rather popular. Statistics show that around 35% of U.S. adults are obese and over 67% are overweight or obese. To make matters worse, as we age, it is harder to lose and keep weight off because of a significant decrease in the number of calories we burn (called the basal metabolic rate).</description></item><item><title>New guidelines for surgical site infection prevention</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/new-guidelines-for-surgical-site-infection-prevention/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/new-guidelines-for-surgical-site-infection-prevention/</guid><description>As a Houston, Texas medical malpractice lawyer, patients and family members frequently hire me to investigate health concerns that began with surgical site infections.
Surgical site infections are those that develop at the location of an incision, cut, or puncture of the skin and underlying tissue&amp;nbsp;made during the surgery.
Types of surgical site infections
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) describes three different types of surgical site infections. The first, a superficial incisional infection, is limited to the area of the skin where an incision was made.</description></item><item><title>The risk of emergency rooms and doctors botching infection treatment</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-risk-of-emergency-rooms-and-doctors-botching-infection-treatment/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-risk-of-emergency-rooms-and-doctors-botching-infection-treatment/</guid><description>As a Houston, Texas medical malpractice attorney, I have frequently represented clients in lawsuits against hospitals and doctors who have allowed relatively small medical issues to develop into smoldering infections.
Recently, for example, a man in his 50s recently called our office about life-threatening conditions that he developed after botched healthcare provided at a free-standing emergency room in Porter, Texas.
What is surprising is that it all started with something rather simple.</description></item><item><title>Bedsores can develop a lot faster than you think, but can usually be prevented with proper doctor and nursing care</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/bedsores-can-develop-a-lot-faster-than-you-think-but-can-usually-be-prevented-with-proper-doctor-and-nursing-care/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/bedsores-can-develop-a-lot-faster-than-you-think-but-can-usually-be-prevented-with-proper-doctor-and-nursing-care/</guid><description>Years ago, I was working with a wound care expert witness on a case about a patient who developed terrible pressure sores or wounds after he received poor care at a hospital and then a nursing home.

He said, &amp;ldquo;The best way to treat pressure sores is to avoid them in the first place.</description></item><item><title>Look for these signs of an infected surgical incision</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/look-for-these-signs-of-an-infected-surgical-incision/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/look-for-these-signs-of-an-infected-surgical-incision/</guid><description>I recently visited with a new client who had an abdominal hernia repair surgery at North Cypress Medical Center, in the Houston suburb of Cypress, Texas.
As a Houston medical malpractice lawyer, this was not the first time that I had been retained by an injured hernia surgery patient at that hospital.

They contend that doctors and hospitals need special legal protections because there are too many lawsuits against them.
As an experienced Texas medical malpractice lawyer, I agree that there is a medical malpractice&amp;mdash;there are far too many medical errors that seriously injure or kill patients. In my opinion, the best way to encourage more conscientious attention to patient safety is through accountability in civil court.</description></item><item><title>Six signs that a sick person may have sepsis</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/six-signs-that-a-sick-person-may-have-sepsis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/six-signs-that-a-sick-person-may-have-sepsis/</guid><description>Sepsis is a frightening diagnosis that no one wants to hear&amp;mdash;and for good reason.

What is sepsis?
Sepsis is actually a complication of a severe infection, involving a systemic inflammatory response. Overall, the most common location in the body for sepsis is the respiratory system.</description></item><item><title>Four tips to help prevent botched IV attempts and IV infections</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/four-tips-to-help-prevent-botched-iv-attempts-and-iv-infections/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/four-tips-to-help-prevent-botched-iv-attempts-and-iv-infections/</guid><description>I just finished representing the family of a newborn girl who was injured shortly after birth.

Before any type of surgery, the surgeon or nurse will go over a consent form with the patient, including an area that deals with the risk of infection.</description></item><item><title>Infections in nursing homes or rehabilitation facilities can be deadly</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/infections-in-nursing-homes-or-rehabilitation-facilities-can-be-deadly/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/infections-in-nursing-homes-or-rehabilitation-facilities-can-be-deadly/</guid><description>When patients are near the end of a hospitalization for a surgery or other illness, they sometimes need some additional care before they can go home. In these situations, case managers and doctors will often transfer patients to a nursing home or skilled nursing facility, like Manor Care Willowbrook, in Houston, or a rehabilitation facility, like Reliant Rehabilitation Hospital North Houston, in Shenandoah.
Patients and their families should realize that skilled nursing and rehabilitation facilities are frequently not set up to treat serious infections or to manage patients who are on multiple strong medications.</description></item><item><title>How to spot life-threatening infections and sepsis</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-to-spot-life-threatening-infections-and-sepsis/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-to-spot-life-threatening-infections-and-sepsis/</guid><description>Infections occur when bacteria or fungi invade the human body and then start multiplying and feeding. There are many types of infections that we commonly hear about, including staph infections, MRSA infections (methicillin-resistant staph aureus), bedsores and infected catheters or lines.
It is always a serious matter when a patient has an active infection. Prompt diagnosis is important because the faster treatment begins, the more likely the infection can be killed and the patient can go on with his or her life.</description></item><item><title>Painter Law Firm negotiates $550,000 settlement for client in medical malpractice infection case</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/painter-law-firm-negotiates-550000-settlement-for-client-in-medical-malpractice-infection-case/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Apr 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/painter-law-firm-negotiates-550000-settlement-for-client-in-medical-malpractice-infection-case/</guid><description>Painter Law Firm represented a client who was severely injured after a surgery when a nurse missed clear signs and symptoms of an infection.
The patient was being treated at a Houston-area hospital following a lap-band surgery.
