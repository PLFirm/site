Optometrists focus on generalized eye exams and prescribing corrective lenses (eyeglasses and contact lenses). They didn&amp;rsquo;t attend medical school, but rather received doctoral degrees from the school of optometry. When they encounter complex medical issues of the eye, they should refer patients to an ophthalmologist.
Ophthalmologists are physicians who attended medical school and have advanced clinical training on treating eye diseases.</description></item></channel></rss>
