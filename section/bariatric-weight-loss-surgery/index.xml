Reaching a healthy weight has a host of benefits, which can sometimes include eliminating other conditions such as hypertension (high blood pressure) and diabetes.
There are all kinds of minimally-invasive weight loss surgical options, including gastric sleeve (sleeve gastrectomy), gastric bypass, a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BDP-DS), and adjustable gastric banding (lap band).</description></item><item><title>Can bariatric surgery errors cause inability to keep food down?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/can-bariatric-surgery-errors-cause-inability-to-keep-food-down/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/can-bariatric-surgery-errors-cause-inability-to-keep-food-down/</guid><description>When some people have difficulty maintaining weight at a healthy level, they consider bariatric weight loss surgery. Bariatric surgeons tout the health benefits of weight-loss surgery, which can include reducing blood pressure to a normal range, curing diabetes, and helping with sleep apnea. There&amp;rsquo;s no doubt that many people have had positive experiences of bariatric surgery.
As with any surgery, though, it&amp;rsquo;s important to be fully informed before making the decision to proceed with the weight-loss surgery.</description></item><item><title>Peer-reviewed study: 5-10% of patients develop neurologic injuries after bariatric surgery</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/peer-reviewed-study-5-10-of-patients-develop-neurologic-injuries-after-bariatric-surgery/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/peer-reviewed-study-5-10-of-patients-develop-neurologic-injuries-after-bariatric-surgery/</guid><description>A peer reviewed study&amp;nbsp;by bariatric surgeons found that 5&amp;ndash;10% of patients have neurologic complications after bariatric weight loss surgery.
Instead of nerve injuries&amp;nbsp;occurring during surgery itself, though, bariatric neurologic problems almost always are related to nutritional deficits.

There are three popular procedures of bariatric weight loss surgery: gastric bands (lap bands), gastric sleeves (sleeve gastrectomy), and biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD/DS).
Sleeve Gastrectomy
The safest surgical option is considered the vertical sleeve gastrectomy, which involves stapling and surgically removing over 85% of the patient&amp;rsquo;s stomach. The remaining part of the patient&amp;rsquo;s stomach is long and narrow, looking like a shirt sleeve, which explains the procedure&amp;rsquo;s name.</description></item><item><title>What type of follow-up care will my bariatric weight loss surgeon use?

There are two important things that every bariatric patient should remember when it comes to post-surgical care.
1. In the short-term after a bariatric weight loss surgery, pay attention and be vocal about pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. They could be telltale signs that something is wrong.
2. In the long-term, keep a close eye on nutrition.</description></item><item><title>The 3 most common problems a lawyer hears from people who had bariatric weight loss surgery</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-3-most-common-problems-a-lawyer-hears-from-people-who-had-bariatric-weight-loss-surgery/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-3-most-common-problems-a-lawyer-hears-from-people-who-had-bariatric-weight-loss-surgery/</guid><description>Diets, exercise, medications, supplements: For some people, it seems that no matter what they try, itâ€™s impossible to get their excess weight off.

Years ago, I asked a nationally known bariatric surgery expert about his thoughts on the growing trend of weight loss surgery.

Thereâ€™s no doubt of the significant health risks posed by obesity and that many people have benefited from weight loss surgery. However, thatâ€™s not to say that bariatric surgery doesnâ€™t come with its own risks.

Studies like this remind me of the old saying about how experience teaches.
In health care, experience is certainly important. This includes learning from mistakes. That&amp;rsquo;s why when there are certain bad outcomes&amp;mdash;sentinel events&amp;mdash;accreditation standards and the standard of care require a root cause analysis. The idea is to figure out why health care mistakes happen and to incorporate training to prevent them from being repeated.</description></item><item><title>Bariatric weight loss surgery can cause permanent nerve, brain injuries</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/bariatric-weight-loss-surgery-can-cause-permanent-nerve-brain-injuries/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/bariatric-weight-loss-surgery-can-cause-permanent-nerve-brain-injuries/</guid><description>Bariatric weight loss surgery has been a good solution for many people who struggle to maintain a healthy weight.

In my experience, many bariatric weight loss surgeons do a great job at selling the potential health and body appearance benefits of surgery, but they downplay&amp;mdash;or don&amp;rsquo;t mention at all&amp;mdash;the potential for problems. One of the most common problems is malnutrition.

Based on my experience as a Houston, Texas medical malpractice attorney, I&amp;rsquo;ve found that many bariatric surgical practices are run like an assembly line. Patients are often managed in groups, rather than as individuals. Things often start with a pre-operative group sales pitch.

Volvulus is a condition where the small intestines loop or twist around each other. It is an emergency medical condition because it cuts off blood flow to the intestines and causes bowel obstruction. In adults, volvulus occurs more frequently in patients who have had an abdominal, bariatric, or weight loss surgery. This is because of adhesive bands or scarring that forms between organs and tissues, which can contribute to volvulus.</description></item><item><title>Bariatric/weight loss surgery malpractice and malnutrition</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/bariatric/weight-loss-surgery-malpractice-and-malnutrition/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/bariatric/weight-loss-surgery-malpractice-and-malnutrition/</guid><description>In my law practice as a Houston, Texas medical malpractice attorney, I have handled a lot of cases involving bariatric/weight loss surgery.
Why weight loss surgery is popular
I guess it should not be surprising that bariatric surgery has become rather popular. Statistics show that around 35% of U.S. adults are obese and over 67% are overweight or obese. To make matters worse, as we age, it is harder to lose and keep weight off because of a significant decrease in the number of calories we burn (called the basal metabolic rate).</description></item><item><title>Bariatric weight-loss surgery benefits, risks, and medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/bariatric-weight-loss-surgery-benefits-risks-and-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/bariatric-weight-loss-surgery-benefits-risks-and-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>As bariatric weight-loss procedures have become increasingly popular, I have handled more and more bariatric surgery cases in my law practice as a Houston, Texas medical malpractice attorney.
Over the years, some procedures became widely used, only to later fall from favor. One of the first bariatric surgery malpractice cases that I handled involved such a procedure, gastric imbrication. Gastric imbrication seems to be rarely used these days.
