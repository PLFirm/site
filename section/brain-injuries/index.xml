Anyone who has a head injury from falling, a motor vehicle accident, or other traumatic cause can develop this lethal condition.
Research shows that patients are diagnosed with traumatic subdural hematomas in around 10&amp;ndash;20% of all traumatic brain injury cases. The high risk is shown by the fact that subdural hematomas are present in up to 30% of all injuries that cause death.</description></item><item><title>Hospitalized patients are particularly at risk during this time period</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/hospitalized-patients-are-particularly-at-risk-during-this-time-period/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/hospitalized-patients-are-particularly-at-risk-during-this-time-period/</guid><description>The Joint Commission, a healthcare accrediting agency, describes hand-off communications as the transfer and acceptance of patient care between physicians, providers, or nurses.
Hand-off communications happen thousands of times every day. There should be a handoff communication every time a nurse changes shifts or a new attending or resident physician rotates onto a service.
As a former hospital administrator, I recall this topic coming up frequently. Registered nurses can be diligent about tending to a patient during the whole shift, only to drop the ball when care is transferred to a new nurse.</description></item><item><title>Man ends up with anoxic brain injury after facet injections to relief lumbar back pain</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/man-ends-up-with-anoxic-brain-injury-after-facet-injections-to-relief-lumbar-back-pain/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/man-ends-up-with-anoxic-brain-injury-after-facet-injections-to-relief-lumbar-back-pain/</guid><description>According to a lawsuit pending in a Harris County, Texas District Court, a patient suffered a severe anoxic brain injury while receiving facet nerve blocks for severe lumbar spine pain. The lawsuit named Vista Community Medical Center, LLP d/b/a Surgery Specialty Hospitals of America and three physicians as defendants in the medical malpractice case.
Lumbar, or lower back, pain can be intense and disabling. One surgical treatment option is a facet or selective nerve root block.</description></item><item><title>Herpes simplex virus encephalitis treatment and medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/herpes-simplex-virus-encephalitis-treatment-and-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/herpes-simplex-virus-encephalitis-treatment-and-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>A recent opinion entered by the Amarillo Court of Appeals provides some interesting insights about the standard of care for treatment of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and encephalitis. The case is styled Alexandra Boske, MD and St. David&amp;rsquo;s Neurology, PLLC, Gayatri Velayudhan Nair, MD and Austin Infectious Disease Consultants, PA v. Kristin Rougeau, No. 07&amp;ndash;20-002285-CV. You can read the opinion here.
Of course, based on the nature of this interrogatory appeal, the defendant healthcare providers felt that the reports from plaintiff&amp;rsquo;s infectious diseases and neurology expert physicians failed to provide sufficient evidence about the allegations.</description></item><item><title>What neuroradiologists look for to identify hypoxic-ischemic brain injury</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-neuroradiologists-look-for-to-identify-hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-neuroradiologists-look-for-to-identify-hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury/</guid><description>When there&amp;rsquo;s a suspicion or confirmation that a newborn infant has a brain injury, it&amp;rsquo;s common for a neonatologist or physician to order an MRI scan of the brain. This is the diagnostic radiology study of choice for determining the basic cause and timing of the serious brain injury.
One devastating type of newborn brain injury is hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE).
HIE is the description for a medical condition that occurs when the brain doesn&amp;rsquo;t get sufficient oxygen and blood flow.</description></item><item><title>What you should know when a Texas doctor or hospital talks about brain death</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-you-should-know-when-a-texas-doctor-or-hospital-talks-about-brain-death/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-you-should-know-when-a-texas-doctor-or-hospital-talks-about-brain-death/</guid><description>Given the current state of Texas law, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but be suspicious when doctors and hospital staff member start talking about brain death.
You see, since 1999, Texas is had the worst law in America when it comes to end-of-life medical decision-making. Under the Advance Directives Act of 1999, which is codified at Texas Health &amp;amp; Safety Code Chapter 166.046, a hospital committee has the ultimate authority in most cases.</description></item><item><title>Substantial settlement in Texas brain injury medical malpractice case will take care of patient's future care needs</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/substantial-settlement-in-texas-brain-injury-medical-malpractice-case-will-take-care-of-patients-future-care-needs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/substantial-settlement-in-texas-brain-injury-medical-malpractice-case-will-take-care-of-patients-future-care-needs/</guid><description>Painter Law Firm negotiated a medical malpractice settlement of $3,500,000 on behalf of a patient and family arising from a tragic permanent brain injury.
The patient&amp;rsquo;s problems began with a persistent headache, nausea, and vomiting. Although it’s easy to consider these symptoms to be from a cold or fatigue, when this constellation of symptoms is present and persistent, it could be a sign of a serious brain condition. That’s why it’s important to get seen by a doctor.</description></item><item><title>What can the trial court consider at a Chapter 74 preliminary expert report hearing in a Texas medical malpractice case?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-can-the-trial-court-consider-at-a-chapter-74-preliminary-expert-report-hearing-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-case/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-can-the-trial-court-consider-at-a-chapter-74-preliminary-expert-report-hearing-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-case/</guid><description>Texas law requires medical malpractice plaintiffs to produce one or more medical expert reports within 120 days of each defendant filing an answer and a lawsuit. The standards for these reports are demanding, requiring separate statements of the applicable standard of care (what should have been done), how the standard of care was violated (what wasn&amp;rsquo;t done correctly), and how those medical mistakes proximately caused harm to the plaintiff.
How do defendants respond to the preliminary expert reports, and what are the potential consequences?</description></item><item><title>Aqueductal stenosis, obstructive hydrocephalus, and the risks of delaying surgery</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/aqueductal-stenosis-obstructive-hydrocephalus-and-the-risks-of-delaying-surgery/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/aqueductal-stenosis-obstructive-hydrocephalus-and-the-risks-of-delaying-surgery/</guid><description>Given the limited space in the head, anything that takes up too much room in your brain can cause life-threatening problems.
Hydrocephalus is one of those medical conditions, with a name that literally means &amp;ldquo;water on the head.&amp;rdquo; More accurately, hydrocephalus is caused by a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain. Doctors diagnose this condition based on a diagnostic radiology workup with a CT scan and/or MRI scan.</description></item><item><title>Hospital, doctors fail to apply c-collar to car wreck patient, leading to quadriplegia</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/hospital-doctors-fail-to-apply-c-collar-to-car-wreck-patient-leading-to-quadriplegia/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/hospital-doctors-fail-to-apply-c-collar-to-car-wreck-patient-leading-to-quadriplegia/</guid><description>One of the most challenging aspects of hospital care for patients after a motor vehicle accident (MVA) is quickly identifying all the injuries and deciding what needs addressed first.
Any time I think about or review a new case regarding this topic, my mind wanders back to a case that I handled early in my career. It involved a young man out driving with a friend. He was a passenger seated in the front seat of the car, and not wearing a seatbelt, when they smashed into a parked car at high speed.</description></item><item><title>Patient falls at nursing home, causing brain bleeding, death</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/patient-falls-at-nursing-home-causing-brain-bleeding-death/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/patient-falls-at-nursing-home-causing-brain-bleeding-death/</guid><description>Lots of bad things can happen to patients in the hospital. These complications and events occur so frequently, in fact, that the healthcare industry has come up with a special name for them&amp;mdash;iatrogenic injuries, meaning hospital-or healthcare-acquired injuries.
As an Houston, Texas medical malpractice attorneys, one of our jobs responsibilities is to distinguish between complications that were unavoidable even with good care, as opposed to problems caused by medical mistakes or negligence.</description></item><item><title>Hospital sodium management, central pontine myelinolysis, and brain injury</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/hospital-sodium-management-central-pontine-myelinolysis-and-brain-injury/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/hospital-sodium-management-central-pontine-myelinolysis-and-brain-injury/</guid><description>Sodium is an electrolyte that is important to the normal function of our bodies. After any trauma or surgery, it&amp;rsquo;s common for the sodium levels in the blood (called serum sodium) to drop. This is even more so true for any surgery or trauma involving the head.
The standard of care requires physicians, internal medicine specialists, hospital laboratories, and nursing staff to monitor post-operative serum sodium levels in post-operative patients.</description></item><item><title>Neurologist roles and neurology medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/neurologist-roles-and-neurology-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/neurologist-roles-and-neurology-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>Neurologists are doctors with specialized training to diagnose and treat brain, spinal cord, and nervous system disorders.
Primary care physicians or hospitalists frequently make referrals or order consultations to neurologists to work up potential issues.
The standard of care requires neurologists to make a careful evaluation of patients using a thorough physical exam and tests that show whether the patient has a normal neurological function. These tests include things such as carnial nerves, reflexes, motor strength movement, sensation, and balance.</description></item><item><title>Delayed treatment of hydrocephalus and increased intracranial pressure is dangerous and deadly</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/delayed-treatment-of-hydrocephalus-and-increased-intracranial-pressure-is-dangerous-and-deadly/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/delayed-treatment-of-hydrocephalus-and-increased-intracranial-pressure-is-dangerous-and-deadly/</guid><description>Hydrocephalus is a medical condition where a person has a buildup of fluid in the brain.
It&amp;rsquo;s potentially dangerous when it&amp;rsquo;s not promptly diagnosed and treated because the skull only has so much room. Anything that occupies that precious space, including fluid, causes an increase in intracranial pressure and the brain itself to shift positions. In the worst cases, the brain is squeezed down through the back of the skull in a deadly situation called brain herniation.</description></item><item><title>Brain swelling, increased pressure can cause deadly brain herniation</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/brain-swelling-increased-pressure-can-cause-deadly-brain-herniation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/brain-swelling-increased-pressure-can-cause-deadly-brain-herniation/</guid><description>There&amp;rsquo;s only so much room in your skull. If something takes up too much space within the skull, it can cause a potentially-deadly brain herniation.
Brain herniation is the movement of brain tissue from an area of high pressure (within the skull) to an area where there&amp;rsquo;s less pressure (eventually down through the foramen magnum, the hole in the back bottom of the skull where the brain connects to the spinal cord).</description></item><item><title>Waco ER doctor doesn't order head CT scan, two days later young patient has permanent brain injury</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/waco-er-doctor-doesnt-order-head-ct-scan-two-days-later-young-patient-has-permanent-brain-injury/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/waco-er-doctor-doesnt-order-head-ct-scan-two-days-later-young-patient-has-permanent-brain-injury/</guid><description>I spent some time in medical school and as a hospital administrator before going to law school and becoming a Houston, Texas medical malpractice attorney. One of the very first concepts that I remember learning in medical school is the importance of a differential diagnosis.
Differential diagnosis is an intensive thought process where the doctor considers the patient as an individual and lists every potential diagnosis that could explain the patient&amp;rsquo;s condition or problems.</description></item><item><title>Sodium levels are important for injuries and conditions involving the brain</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/sodium-levels-are-important-for-injuries-and-conditions-involving-the-brain/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/sodium-levels-are-important-for-injuries-and-conditions-involving-the-brain/</guid><description>Any time a potential client calls Painter Law Firm because of hospital care for neurological problems involving the brain, the first thing I want to look for in the medical records is sodium.
From my experience as a Houston, Texas medical malpractice attorney, I know that anything causing brain swelling or that occupies space within the cranial cavity can have a big impact on serum sodium levels.
Some experts refer to any such conditions as space-occupying lesions, because of the very limited space within the cranial cavity.</description></item><item><title>Bariatric surgery and the dangerous complication of malnutrition-related Wernickeâ€™s encephalopathy</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/bariatric-surgery-and-the-dangerous-complication-of-malnutrition-related-wernicke%C3%A2s-encephalopathy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/bariatric-surgery-and-the-dangerous-complication-of-malnutrition-related-wernicke%C3%A2s-encephalopathy/</guid><description>Bariatric weight-loss surgery offers help for many people struggling to attain or manage a healthy weight. It&amp;rsquo;s not without risks, though.
Based on my experience as a Houston, Texas medical malpractice attorney, I&amp;rsquo;ve found that many bariatric surgical practices are run like an assembly line. Patients are often managed in groups, rather than as individuals. Things often start with a pre-operative group sales pitch. Next, a lobby full of patients are run through an operating room on a given day for surgery.</description></item><item><title>What you should know about the differences between concussions and brain injuries</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-you-should-know-about-the-differences-between-concussions-and-brain-injuries/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-you-should-know-about-the-differences-between-concussions-and-brain-injuries/</guid><description>Researchers recently released results from a study into the effect of educating parents about the difference between a concussion and a brain injury.

As a parent, I know there&amp;rsquo;s a lot more education and public awareness about concussions and childhood sports, at least since I grew up and played basketball in the 1980s.</description></item><item><title>New guideline for treating pediatric mild traumatic brain injuries</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/new-guideline-for-treating-pediatric-mild-traumatic-brain-injuries/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/new-guideline-for-treating-pediatric-mild-traumatic-brain-injuries/</guid><description>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control &amp;amp; Prevention (CDC) announced a comprehensive guideline on diagnosing and imaging pediatric mild traumatic brain injury cases. The guideline was published today as a special communication in the journal JAMA Pediatrics. While an adult guideline has been in place for several years, this is the first-ever treatment guideline specific to pediatric patients.
There is no doubt that mild traumatic brain injury in children has been in the news a lot in recent years.</description></item><item><title>Three types of neonatal meningitis medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/three-types-of-neonatal-meningitis-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/three-types-of-neonatal-meningitis-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>No matter what the age of the person, meningitis is a dreaded diagnosis.
Meningitis is defined as the inflammation of the meninges (membranes) that surround the brain and spinal cord. Bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, and amoeba can all cause meningitis.
Meningitis is more common in the neonatal period, meaning babies less than 44 days old, than in any other age group. It is so common, in fact, that this condition is referred to as neonatal meningitis.</description></item><item><title>High school senior dies after doctors botch diagnosis and treatment of acute disseminated encephalomalacia (ADEM)</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/high-school-senior-dies-after-doctors-botch-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-acute-disseminated-encephalomalacia-adem/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/high-school-senior-dies-after-doctors-botch-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-acute-disseminated-encephalomalacia-adem/</guid><description>As a Houston, Texas medical malpractice lawyer, every day my law firm hears tragic stories from clients&amp;nbsp;about how lives were changed or ended because of poor medical care.

Depositions are an important part of almost every civil lawsuit.
A deposition is basically a meeting where an attorney can ask a party or witness in the lawsuit questions under oath in front of a court reporter, with all of the other attorneys present. It is typically not done in the courthouse, but rather in an attorney&amp;rsquo;s office.</description></item><item><title>Brain aneurysm symptoms, treatment, and medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/brain-aneurysm-symptoms-treatment-and-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/brain-aneurysm-symptoms-treatment-and-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>In my law practice as a Houston, Texas medical malpractice attorney, I have had the opportunity of representing a number of clients who sought treatment for a terrible headache.
Any time I hear people say that they have the worst headache of their life, it gets my attention.

Generally speaking, an aneurysm is a bit like a hernia of a blood vessel. It is a spot in the wall of a blood vessel that is weak, and causes a bulge.
