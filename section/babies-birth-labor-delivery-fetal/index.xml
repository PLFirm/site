While cord blood gas results can provide insight into a baby&amp;rsquo;s condition, defense experts in birth injury lawsuits often wrongly argue that normal values completely rule out hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), brain injuries, and other neurologic injuries.
If your child has suffered brain damage and you&amp;rsquo;re being told their cord blood gases were normal, do not accept this at face value - there is much more to the story.</description></item><item><title>Legal Time Bomb: Birth Injury Lawsuit Limitations in Texas Explained</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/birth-injury-lawsuit-limitations-in-texas-explained/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/birth-injury-lawsuit-limitations-in-texas-explained/</guid><description>Over the past few weeks, our team has talked with three sets of parents who have three and four year old children with brain injuries called hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE).

Common types of obstetric anesthesia
For vaginal or natural deliveries, obstetric anesthesiologists and CRNAs often use an&amp;nbsp;epidural&amp;nbsp;for pain control. Epidural anesthesia is delivered by a catheter that&amp;rsquo;s inserted into the epidural space of the mother&amp;rsquo;s spine usually near the T10&amp;ndash;L1 level. It&amp;rsquo;s usually a continuous infusion of anesthetic medication until after the baby is delivered.</description></item><item><title>Neonatal seizures, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), and medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/neonatal-seizures-hypoxic-ischemic-encephalopathy-hie-and-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/neonatal-seizures-hypoxic-ischemic-encephalopathy-hie-and-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>Neonatal seizures or convulsions are a type of epileptic fits that affect newborns in their first 28 days of life.
Types of neonatal seizures
The seizures experienced by newborns are different than those that older children and adults experience. Pediatricians and neurologists use four different descriptions for neonatal seizures:
&amp;bull; Subtle seizures: Accounting for 50% of neonatal seizures, these have clinical signs that are frequently overlooked.
&amp;bull; Clonic seizures: 25% of neonatal seizures are in this category, which is characterized by jerking movements of the muscles.</description></item><item><title>The role of Apgar scores in birth injury and medical malpractice cases</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-role-of-apgar-scores-in-birth-injury-and-medical-malpractice-cases/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-role-of-apgar-scores-in-birth-injury-and-medical-malpractice-cases/</guid><description>When a baby is diagnosed with a birth-related brain injury, obstetricians, pediatricians, neonatologists, and pediatric neurologists look at the newborn&amp;rsquo;s Apgar scores to help figure out what happened.
What are Apgar scores?
Apgar scores have been around for over 70 years.
According to a 2015 committee opinion from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), Apgar scores are an accepted and convenient method for reporting a newborn&amp;rsquo;s status immediately after birth and after any necessary resuscitation.</description></item><item><title>The role of cord blood gases in birth injury and medical malpractice cases</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-role-of-cord-blood-gases-in-birth-injury-and-medical-malpractice-cases/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-role-of-cord-blood-gases-in-birth-injury-and-medical-malpractice-cases/</guid><description>Both in legal and medical settings, where there&amp;rsquo;s a reason to investigate potential causes of labor and delivery or birth injuries, several factors or sources of evidence are considered. In addition to findings from electronic fetal monitoring, some assessments after delivery are often helpful. These include cord blood gas analysis and Apgar scores.
What is cord blood gas?
The umbilical cord is basically the anatomical connection between the mom and the baby she&amp;rsquo;s carrying.</description></item><item><title>How to pick the right Texas attorney for your HIE or birth injury medical malpractice case</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-to-pick-the-right-texas-attorney-for-your-hie-or-birth-injury-medical-malpractice-case/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-to-pick-the-right-texas-attorney-for-your-hie-or-birth-injury-medical-malpractice-case/</guid><description>Hiring the right attorney to handle a Texas labor and delivery hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) or birth-related brain injury medical malpractice case is an important decision.

It&amp;rsquo;s also called hyperbilirubinemia.
What is jaundice/ hyperbilirubinemia?
When excessive amounts of bilirubin accumulate in the blood it causes hyperbilirubinemia.
Bilirubin is a yellowish pigment that the body generates when red blood cells are broken down. When a baby has too much bilirubin in the blood it causes the characteristic yellow discoloration of the eyes and skin that people associate with jaundice.</description></item><item><title>Pitocin causes excessive contractions, brain injury in baby</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/pitocin-causes-excessive-contractions-brain-injury-in-baby/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/pitocin-causes-excessive-contractions-brain-injury-in-baby/</guid><description>Obstetricians (OB/GYNs) sometimes recommend induction of labor when a pregnant woman reaches full term but hasn&amp;rsquo;t delivered her baby.
What is induction of labor?
Doctors and labor and delivery nurses induce labor by injecting Pitocin (a manufactured form of oxytocin) into an intravenous (IV) line. Pitocin causes the uterus to start contracting and often succeeds in getting active labor underway before it would&amp;rsquo;ve happened on its own.
Sometimes induction of labor is largely for convenience, but there are a variety of medical reasons why a physician may recommend it:</description></item><item><title>$4 million for pregnant mom who died after C-Section</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/4-million-for-pregnant-mom-who-died-after-c-section/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/4-million-for-pregnant-mom-who-died-after-c-section/</guid><description>The parties to a preeclampsia medical negligence lawsuit reached a $4 million settlement after a pregnant mother died in the hospital shortly after an emergency C-section delivery.

First, thereâ€™s advance notice. In other words, everyone knows for many months that a baby is on the way. As part of prenatal care, the obstetrician (OB/GYN) sets an estimated due date.&amp;nbsp;
Next, thereâ€™s familiarity.

Oxytocin is the generic version of the brand-name medication Pitocin. These drugs are used to induce, augment, or stimulate expectant mothers to go into labor. They work by causing the uterus to contract.
The prevalence of oxytocin in hospital labor and delivery units has dramatically grown; thus, so, too, have the risks.

Throughout rearing our children, we hear from pediatricians about how they&amp;rsquo;re developing in terms of height and weight. Very early on, pediatricians chart out an expected growth curve to predict how tall our children will grow&amp;mdash;and to draw attention to any problem that may need medical attention all the way that&amp;rsquo;s pushing them off the curve.</description></item><item><title>Hemorrhaging and preeclampsia are two top causes of maternal deaths in pregnancy</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/hemorrhaging-and-preeclampsia-are-two-top-causes-of-maternal-deaths-in-pregnancy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/hemorrhaging-and-preeclampsia-are-two-top-causes-of-maternal-deaths-in-pregnancy/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Most pregnancy-related deaths are preventable, demonstrating the need to identify and implement strategies to address the multiple contributing factors.&amp;rdquo; That sentence in a report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) captured my attention.

It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that long ago that many serious neurological conditions affecting a baby couldn&amp;rsquo;t be discovered until birth. Now, though, with quality prenatal care by a competent OB/GYN physician, many fetal conditions can be diagnosed during pregnancy and corrected while the baby is still in the womb.</description></item><item><title>Texas Supreme Court opinion changes birth injury standard of proof</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-supreme-court-opinion-changes-birth-injury-standard-of-proof/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-supreme-court-opinion-changes-birth-injury-standard-of-proof/</guid><description>I have always felt that punctuation is under-appreciated.

In time, the focus naturally shifts to finding the best care possible for your baby. Some babies may have profound brain injuries that will require a lifetime of round-the-clock care.

Many surgeons were taught that a precise surgical cut would heal better than a natural tear that might happen as the baby passes through the birth canal.
The standard of care has changed, though, and now discourages OB/GYN doctors from routinely performing episiotomies.

The textbook sign of preeclampsia is pregnancy-related high blood pressure (hypertension). Some people describe it as a silent killer because no one can feel the increase in blood pressure.

Through this experience, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed some common themes in these sad and tragic cases.
Labor and delivery birth injuries
In some cases, the babies were injured just before birth because of placenta or other problems that caused fetal distress, leading to a hypoxic/ischemic injury. We call these acute conditions. In this type of injury, there&amp;rsquo;s not enough oxygen getting to the brain and vital organs, which causes permanent damage.</description></item><item><title>New standards announced to protect full-term babies born in hospitals</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/new-standards-announced-to-protect-full-term-babies-born-in-hospitals/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/new-standards-announced-to-protect-full-term-babies-born-in-hospitals/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s not so easy to pick a new doctor.
As a Houston, Texas medical malpractice attorney, I have a good feel for how most people do it. They start by looking at who&amp;rsquo;s in-network for their health insurance. Next comes looking for what doctors are nearby. And finally, figure out who will give you an appointment in a reasonable time frame.
What&amp;rsquo;s interesting about that is none of that matters when it comes to finding a doctor who&amp;rsquo;s competent and safe.</description></item><item><title>Four birth-related injuries that may be preventable</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/four-birth-related-injuries-that-may-be-preventable/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/four-birth-related-injuries-that-may-be-preventable/</guid><description>One of the reasons I believe that medical malpractice lawsuits have a significant positive influence on safe patient care is the attention they bring to common problems in health care.
Sadly, in my experience, many Texas hospitals, nurses, and doctors continue to repeat the same mistakes over and over again, causing avoidable patient injuries and death. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be that way, though.

One of the most common conditions in newborns is jaundice, also called hyperbilirubinemia, which causes the skin to turn yellow. About 60% of newborns and 80% of premature babies develop jaundice. Bilirubin, a pigment or chemical naturally found in our bodies, is the culprit or cause of jaundice in babies.</description></item><item><title>Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital CAPS Team &amp; what you should know about it</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/childrens-memorial-hermann-hospital-caps-team-what-you-should-know-about-it/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/childrens-memorial-hermann-hospital-caps-team-what-you-should-know-about-it/</guid><description>I recently met with a new father whose infant has been bounced around three Memorial Hermann hospitals in her short life.

Hi Robert Painter, and today we are going to be talking about a birth injury called Erb&amp;#39;s palsy, or also known as a brachial plexus injury.
Now the brachial plexus refers to a bundle of nerves that is found in on both sides of our bodies, really in the armpit area. Now during the birth process those nerves can get injured, and those can have devastating effects because the brachial plexus takes care of the motor, or the movement, function, in our arms, as well as the in sensation we have in this whole area - and even into the chest to some extent.</description></item><item><title>Video: Prenatal visits and fundal height measurement can save lives</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/video-prenatal-visits-and-fundal-height-measurement-can-save-lives/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/video-prenatal-visits-and-fundal-height-measurement-can-save-lives/</guid><description>Today we&amp;rsquo;re going to speak about something that happens in every prenatal visit&amp;mdash;or at least it should in any prenatal visit with an OB/GYN&amp;mdash;and that&amp;rsquo;s the fundal height measurement.
