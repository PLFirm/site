Imagine the moment: You&amp;rsquo;re in the delivery room, contractions intensifying, and suddenly the medical team mentions &amp;ldquo;meconium&amp;rdquo; in hushed tones. What was supposed to be a joyous arrival turns into a whirlwind of concern.
When there&amp;rsquo;s an unexpected bad outcome at birth, parents are often told that meconium alone was the cause, leading to brain damage or lifelong disabilities.</description></item><item><title>Group B Streptococcus (GBS) Risks and Medical Malpractice: Protecting Mothers and Newborns</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/group-b-streptococcus-babies-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/group-b-streptococcus-babies-malpractice/</guid><description>As a Texas medical malpractice attorney, I’ve seen firsthand the devastating consequences when doctors, physician assistances, nurse practitioners, and registered nurses providers fail to follow established standards of care. One critical area where such failures can have tragic outcomes is in the management of Group B Streptococcus (GBS) during pregnancy and delivery.
The truth be told, GBS is a common type of bacteria that’s generally harmless in healthy adults. Like all bacteria, though, when GBS colonizes and grows in the wrong place, it can cause serious problems.</description></item><item><title>Texas Midwife Lawyer: Understanding Your Rights and Risks in Midwife Care</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-midwife-lawyer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-midwife-lawyer/</guid><description>Birth centers are a popular option for couples who appreciate the collaborative approach and softer, compassionate approach of midwife care.

Common types of obstetric anesthesia
For vaginal or natural deliveries, obstetric anesthesiologists and CRNAs often use an&amp;nbsp;epidural&amp;nbsp;for pain control. Epidural anesthesia is delivered by a catheter that&amp;rsquo;s inserted into the epidural space of the mother&amp;rsquo;s spine usually near the T10&amp;ndash;L1 level. It&amp;rsquo;s usually a continuous infusion of anesthetic medication until after the baby is delivered.</description></item><item><title>Neonatal seizures, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), and medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/neonatal-seizures-hypoxic-ischemic-encephalopathy-hie-and-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/neonatal-seizures-hypoxic-ischemic-encephalopathy-hie-and-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>Neonatal seizures or convulsions are a type of epileptic fits that affect newborns in their first 28 days of life.
Types of neonatal seizures
The seizures experienced by newborns are different than those that older children and adults experience. Pediatricians and neurologists use four different descriptions for neonatal seizures:
&amp;bull; Subtle seizures: Accounting for 50% of neonatal seizures, these have clinical signs that are frequently overlooked.
&amp;bull; Clonic seizures: 25% of neonatal seizures are in this category, which is characterized by jerking movements of the muscles.</description></item><item><title>The role of Apgar scores in birth injury and medical malpractice cases</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-role-of-apgar-scores-in-birth-injury-and-medical-malpractice-cases/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-role-of-apgar-scores-in-birth-injury-and-medical-malpractice-cases/</guid><description>When a baby is diagnosed with a birth-related brain injury, obstetricians, pediatricians, neonatologists, and pediatric neurologists look at the newborn&amp;rsquo;s Apgar scores to help figure out what happened.
What are Apgar scores?
Apgar scores have been around for over 70 years.
According to a 2015 committee opinion from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), Apgar scores are an accepted and convenient method for reporting a newborn&amp;rsquo;s status immediately after birth and after any necessary resuscitation.</description></item><item><title>The role of cord blood gases in birth injury and medical malpractice cases</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-role-of-cord-blood-gases-in-birth-injury-and-medical-malpractice-cases/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-role-of-cord-blood-gases-in-birth-injury-and-medical-malpractice-cases/</guid><description>Both in legal and medical settings, where there&amp;rsquo;s a reason to investigate potential causes of labor and delivery or birth injuries, several factors or sources of evidence are considered. In addition to findings from electronic fetal monitoring, some assessments after delivery are often helpful. These include cord blood gas analysis and Apgar scores.

What is jaundice/ hyperbilirubinemia?
When excessive amounts of bilirubin accumulate in the blood it causes hyperbilirubinemia.
Bilirubin is a yellowish pigment that the body generates when red blood cells are broken down. When a baby has too much bilirubin in the blood it causes the characteristic yellow discoloration of the eyes and skin that people associate with jaundice.</description></item><item><title>Pitocin causes excessive contractions, brain injury in baby</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/pitocin-causes-excessive-contractions-brain-injury-in-baby/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/pitocin-causes-excessive-contractions-brain-injury-in-baby/</guid><description>Obstetricians (OB/GYNs) sometimes recommend induction of labor when a pregnant woman reaches full term but hasn&amp;rsquo;t delivered her baby.
What is induction of labor?
Doctors and labor and delivery nurses induce labor by injecting Pitocin (a manufactured form of oxytocin) into an intravenous (IV) line. Pitocin causes the uterus to start contracting and often succeeds in getting active labor underway before it would&amp;rsquo;ve happened on its own.
Sometimes induction of labor is largely for convenience, but there are a variety of medical reasons why a physician may recommend it:</description></item><item><title>$4 million for pregnant mom who died after C-Section</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/4-million-for-pregnant-mom-who-died-after-c-section/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/4-million-for-pregnant-mom-who-died-after-c-section/</guid><description>The parties to a preeclampsia medical negligence lawsuit reached a $4 million settlement after a pregnant mother died in the hospital shortly after an emergency C-section delivery.

Oxytocin is the generic version of the brand-name medication Pitocin. These drugs are used to induce, augment, or stimulate expectant mothers to go into labor. They work by causing the uterus to contract.
The prevalence of oxytocin in hospital labor and delivery units has dramatically grown; thus, so, too, have the risks.

That was the situation that recently confronted a young couple who planned to have their first child delivered by a midwife at a birthing center. When the midwife realized that something was wrong with the baby that exceeded her training, she appropriately sent the laboring mom to the hospital.</description></item><item><title>There are risks to stopping fetal monitoring before delivery</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/there-are-risks-to-stopping-fetal-monitoring-before-delivery/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/there-are-risks-to-stopping-fetal-monitoring-before-delivery/</guid><description>This morning at the deposition of the labor and delivery nurse who used to work at a hospital in Cypress, Harris County, Texas.

Throughout rearing our children, we hear from pediatricians about how they&amp;rsquo;re developing in terms of height and weight.

Whenever this happens, parents and family members are left devastated, and the OB/GYN physicians and labor and delivery nurses are emotionally impacted, too.
In some situations, a birth-related brain injury is caused by hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). HIE is a condition that takes place during late pregnancy or labor and delivery, in which there is a shortage of oxygen and blood flow to the brain that causes brain damage.</description></item><item><title>Spina bifida diagnosis, pre-birth surgical treatment, and medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/spina-bifida-diagnosis-pre-birth-surgical-treatment-and-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/spina-bifida-diagnosis-pre-birth-surgical-treatment-and-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s amazing to think about all the medical discoveries and advancements that have developed since I started medical school in 1992.
One exciting area that has enjoyed significant progress is prenatal care. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that long ago that many serious neurological conditions affecting a baby couldn&amp;rsquo;t be discovered until birth.

The standard of care has changed, though, and now discourages OB/GYN doctors from routinely performing episiotomies.

The textbook sign of preeclampsia is pregnancy-related high blood pressure (hypertension). Some people describe it as a silent killer because no one can feel the increase in blood pressure.

Through this experience, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed some common themes in these sad and tragic cases.
Labor and delivery birth injuries
In some cases, the babies were injured just before birth because of placenta or other problems that caused fetal distress, leading to a hypoxic/ischemic injury. We call these acute conditions. In this type of injury, there&amp;rsquo;s not enough oxygen getting to the brain and vital organs, which causes permanent damage.</description></item><item><title>New standards announced to protect full-term babies born in hospitals</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/new-standards-announced-to-protect-full-term-babies-born-in-hospitals/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/new-standards-announced-to-protect-full-term-babies-born-in-hospitals/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s not so easy to pick a new doctor.
As a Houston, Texas medical malpractice attorney, I have a good feel for how most people do it. They start by looking at who&amp;rsquo;s in-network for their health insurance. Next comes looking for what doctors are nearby. And finally, figure out who will give you an appointment in a reasonable time frame.
What&amp;rsquo;s interesting about that is none of that matters when it comes to finding a doctor who&amp;rsquo;s competent and safe.</description></item><item><title>Four birth-related injuries that may be preventable</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/four-birth-related-injuries-that-may-be-preventable/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/four-birth-related-injuries-that-may-be-preventable/</guid><description>One of the reasons I believe that medical malpractice lawsuits have a significant positive influence on safe patient care is the attention they bring to common problems in health care.
Sadly, in my experience, many Texas hospitals, nurses, and doctors continue to repeat the same mistakes over and over again, causing avoidable patient injuries and death. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be that way, though.

While most obstetrics/gynecology physicians find shoulder dystocia difficult to predict, the general risk factors are well-known.</description></item><item><title>Prenatal care, testing, and medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/prenatal-care-testing-and-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/prenatal-care-testing-and-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>One of the most important things to do after having a positive pregnancy test, or even suspecting that you might be expecting a baby, is to schedule a prenatal appointment. Although there are various prenatal options for expectant moms, in my experience as a Houston, Texas medical malpractice lawyer, seeking care from a board certified OB/GYN is the safest choice.
Seeking early prenatal care is important because it establishes a baseline for the development of the baby, and increases the safety of both the baby and mother.</description></item><item><title>Jaundice is easy to treat, but dangerous to ignore</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/jaundice-is-easy-to-treat-but-dangerous-to-ignore/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/jaundice-is-easy-to-treat-but-dangerous-to-ignore/</guid><description>As a Houston, Texas medical malpractice lawyer, I handle a lot of cases related to labor and delivery and newborn care.
One of the most common conditions in newborns is jaundice, also called hyperbilirubinemia, which causes the skin to turn yellow. About 60% of newborns and 80% of premature babies develop jaundice. Bilirubin, a pigment or chemical naturally found in our bodies, is the culprit or cause of jaundice in babies.</description></item><item><title>Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital CAPS Team &amp; what you should know about it</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/childrens-memorial-hermann-hospital-caps-team-what-you-should-know-about-it/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/childrens-memorial-hermann-hospital-caps-team-what-you-should-know-about-it/</guid><description>I recently met with a new father whose infant has been bounced around three Memorial Hermann hospitals in her short life.

Hi Robert Painter, and today we are going to be talking about a birth injury called Erb&amp;#39;s palsy, or also known as a brachial plexus injury.
Now the brachial plexus refers to a bundle of nerves that is found in on both sides of our bodies, really in the armpit area. Now during the birth process those nerves can get injured, and those can have devastating effects because the brachial plexus takes care of the motor, or the movement, function, in our arms, as well as the in sensation we have in this whole area - and even into the chest to some extent.</description></item><item><title>Video: Prenatal visits and fundal height measurement can save lives</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/video-prenatal-visits-and-fundal-height-measurement-can-save-lives/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/video-prenatal-visits-and-fundal-height-measurement-can-save-lives/</guid><description>Today we&amp;rsquo;re going to speak about something that happens in every prenatal visit&amp;mdash;or at least it should in any prenatal visit with an OB/GYN&amp;mdash;and that&amp;rsquo;s the fundal height measurement.
