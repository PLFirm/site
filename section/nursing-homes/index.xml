When physicians and nurses fail to timely diagnose and treat sepsis, patients can face serious complications including organ failure, amputations, and even death. For families left dealing with the devastating aftermath of sepsis malpractice, the civil justice system may provide an avenue for recovering needed compensation.
What is sepsis? Sepsis is the body&amp;rsquo;s extreme response to an infection.</description></item><item><title>A Nightmare Unleashed: The Shocking Reality of Medical Identity Mix-ups</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/a-nightmare-unleashed-the-shocking-reality-of-medical-identity-mix-ups/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/a-nightmare-unleashed-the-shocking-reality-of-medical-identity-mix-ups/</guid><description>A few years ago, Painter Law Firm represented a woman in her 70s who lived in a Houston suburb. Let&amp;#39;s refer to her as Sarah.
Sarah was a delightful lady with a grandmotherly smile that brightened everyone&amp;#39;s day. Prior to hiring our firm, she underwent abdominal surgery and was scheduled for a short stay in a skilled nursing facility (SNF) to recover and regain strength before returning home. Despite some hearing difficulties, Sarah led an independent life and was generally healthy.</description></item><item><title>Registered nurse criminally charged, alleged to have amputated patient's foot without order or consent</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/registered-nurse-criminally-charged-alleged-to-have-amputated-patients-foot-without-order-or-consent/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/registered-nurse-criminally-charged-alleged-to-have-amputated-patients-foot-without-order-or-consent/</guid><description>A registered nurse who worked at a skilled nursing and rehabilitation facility was charged in criminal court for amputating a 62-year-old man&amp;rsquo;s foot without consent.
Mary K. Brown, RN pled not guilty to charges including mayhem, physical abuse of an elderly person, and intentionally abusing the patient, causing great bodily harm. The patient&amp;rsquo;s foot was frostbitten, and Nurse Brown allegedly decided to take it upon herself to amputate it without a physician order or the patient&amp;rsquo;s permission.</description></item><item><title>Federal inspectors find multiple facilities with no nurses on site for extending periods of time</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/federal-inspectors-find-multiple-facilities-with-no-nurses-on-site-for-extending-periods-of-time/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/federal-inspectors-find-multiple-facilities-with-no-nurses-on-site-for-extending-periods-of-time/</guid><description>One of the most basic responsibilities of hospitals and nursing homes is to provide an adequate staff of competent registered nurses. Yet, time after time when we speak with new clients, we&amp;rsquo;re told stories of how nurses are nowhere to be found.
While I typically use the phrase nowhere to be found metaphorically, recent reporting by USA Today reveals that it sometimes applies literally.
Federal guidelines require nursing homes to have a registered nurse on duty.</description></item><item><title>Are hospital and nursing home bedsores and pressure injuries avoidable?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/are-hospital-and-nursing-home-bedsores-and-pressure-injuries-avoidable/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/are-hospital-and-nursing-home-bedsores-and-pressure-injuries-avoidable/</guid><description>Bedsores, pressure ulcers, decubitus ulcers: There are a lot of names used to describe pressure injuries that patients develop while receiving care in a hospital or skilled nursing facility. Since 2016, the accepted term recommended by the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel is &amp;ldquo;pressure injury.&amp;rdquo;

I still love those old school surgeons.&amp;rdquo;
Her comment got me thinking about how old school medical care is different than what’s touted as improved care today. Some hospitals and facilities create systems that try and force physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and nurses to serve metrics and computers rather than the patients they&amp;rsquo;re supposed to be taking care of.</description></item><item><title>Lawsuit: High-fall-risk patient at The Medical Resort at Willowbrook falls 5 times</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/lawsuit-high-fall-risk-patient-at-the-medical-resort-at-willowbrook-falls-5-times/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/lawsuit-high-fall-risk-patient-at-the-medical-resort-at-willowbrook-falls-5-times/</guid><description>A widower filed a wrongful death/survival medical malpractice claim against The Medical Resort at Willowbrook, a skilled nursing facility located in northwest Houston, because his wife fell at least five times during her stay.

Hospital or healthcare-acquired injuries are so common, though, that there&amp;rsquo;s a special term to describe them&amp;mdash;iatrogenic injuries.
One of the most common types of iatrogenic injury is pressure injuries. This dreaded condition goes by other names, including decubitus ulcers, pressure sores, and bedsores. These injuries are often avoidable and cause a significant amount of pain and treatment, and even death.</description></item><item><title>Severe bedsores are never events that can be avoided with proper care</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/severe-bedsores-are-never-events-that-can-be-avoided-with-proper-care/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/severe-bedsores-are-never-events-that-can-be-avoided-with-proper-care/</guid><description>Pressure wounds (also called pressure sores, bedsores, or decubitus ulcers) are tissue injuries that are largely preventable.

One physician famously found this out the hard way.

In hospitals, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality data show , up to 1 million patients fall while hospitalized in the United States each year. Over one-third of these falls cause injuries, including fractures or broken bones, head trauma, and even death.

And a &amp;ldquo;prolonged&amp;rdquo; time may only be a matter of hours.
According to the National Pressure Injury Advisory Panel, over 2.5 million patients develop pressure injuries each year, leading to 60,000 avoidable deaths.

The Joint Commission is an accrediting agency for health care facilities, including nursing homes and skilled nursing facilities (SNFs). Its overall goal is to raise the bar on the quality of care provided by accredited facilities.

It also concerns me because federal government reports are one of the few ways that Texas patients and attorneys can pull back the curtain to reveal quality of care secrets that are normally closely guarded by hospitals and nursing homes.</description></item><item><title>Suburban Houston rehab facility overdoses elderly patient on painkillers, causing aspiration pneumonia and death</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/suburban-houston-rehab-facility-overdoses-elderly-patient-on-painkillers-causing-aspiration-pneumonia-and-death/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/suburban-houston-rehab-facility-overdoses-elderly-patient-on-painkillers-causing-aspiration-pneumonia-and-death/</guid><description>I recently met with a man who unexpectedly lost his wife because of medical malpractice.

Before hospitalists came around, a hospitalized patient&amp;rsquo;s attending physician&amp;mdash;the one with the ultimate decision-making responsibility&amp;mdash;might only be in the hospital once a day for rounds. These days, most hospitals have hospitalists on-site 24/7.
Rehabilitation and skilled nursing facilities also rely on hospitalists to manage medications and other medical issues for their patients, although they don&amp;rsquo;t typically have a hospitalist on-site 24/7.</description></item><item><title>Why are Texas nursing homes considered the worst in America?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/why-are-texas-nursing-homes-considered-the-worst-in-america/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/why-are-texas-nursing-homes-considered-the-worst-in-america/</guid><description>As a Houston, Texas medical malpractice lawyer, from time to time clients or friends ask me for a recommendation of the good nursing homes in the Houston area.

Nursing home negligence

Unfortunately, Texas law has created an environment that does not hold healthcare providers financially responsible for providing poor care to elderly, disabled, and unemployed patients.

What is a skilled nursing facility?
Healthcare providers often refer to skilled nursing facilities with the abbreviation &amp;ldquo;SNF,&amp;rdquo; which is pronounced &amp;ldquo;sniff.&amp;rdquo; A skilled nursing facility is a residential facility that provides on-site 24/7 health care.
SNFs are staffed with registered nurses, licensed vocational nurses, and physical, speech, and occupational therapists.</description></item><item><title>New study exposes Texas nursing home anti-psychotic drug over-medication problem</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/new-study-exposes-texas-nursing-home-anti-psychotic-drug-over-medication-problem/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/new-study-exposes-texas-nursing-home-anti-psychotic-drug-over-medication-problem/</guid><description>As a Houston, Texas medical malpractice attorney, I frequently handle cases involving nursing home and hospital medication errors.
