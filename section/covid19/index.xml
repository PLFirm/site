And what I mean by that is an opportunity to do things that you think you could not do before.
To tort reform aficionados in Texas, COVID-19 is a serious crisis that they didn&amp;rsquo;t want to waste without getting more tort reform on the book.

I&amp;rsquo;ve told everyone whoâ€™s asked me that I don&amp;rsquo;t see that happening.
Competent, experienced medical malpractice lawyers in Texas realize that one requirement to pursue any medical malpractice case is to produce expert testimony that defines the applicable standard of care. Generally speaking, the standard of care is what a reasonably prudent hospital/doctor/health care provider would have done under the same or similar circumstances.</description></item></channel></rss>
