About a week earlier, Michael saw his cardiologist because he had new chest pain and shortness of breath when he took short walks. His cardiologist scheduled him for a stent placement at the cardiac catheterization lab (cath lab) to open a blocked coronary artery - a condition sometimes called the &amp;ldquo;widow maker.</description></item><item><title>Pharmacy Malpractice in Texas: All You Need to Know</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/pharmacy-malpractice-texas/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/pharmacy-malpractice-texas/</guid><description>When you fill a prescription at your local, grocery, or chain pharmacy, you trust that the highly trained pharmacist will dispense the correct medication at the proper dosage. But far too often, pharmacy errors lead to dangerous drug interactions, overdoses, and even death. If you or a loved one has been seriously harmed by a medication mistake, you may be entitled to significant compensation under Texas law.
Types of Pharmacy Errors Pharmacy errors can take many forms, but some of the most common include:</description></item><item><title>One state's investigation finds CVS errors in 20% of prescriptions</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/one-states-investigation-finds-cvs-errors-in-20-of-prescriptions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/one-states-investigation-finds-cvs-errors-in-20-of-prescriptions/</guid><description>Would you be surprised to learn that the fourth largest company in the United States is the pharmacy chain CVS Health? (That&amp;rsquo;s according to 2022 total revenue data).
Despite all of those resources, some pharmacists and pharmacy techs complain that mega pharmacy CVS stores are plagued by understaffing that put patients at needless risk.
One state&amp;rsquo;s pharmacy board investigated CVS pharmacies in its jurisdiction in 2019&amp;ndash;2020 and found an error rate of over 20%&amp;mdash;that&amp;rsquo;s 1 out of every 5 prescriptions filled!</description></item><item><title>Medication mix-up causes death of shoulder surgery patient</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/medication-mix-up-causes-death-of-shoulder-surgery-patient/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/medication-mix-up-causes-death-of-shoulder-surgery-patient/</guid><description>An academic orthopedic surgeon who&amp;rsquo;s part of a medical school faculty was recently ordered to get more training for remedial education by a state medical board over operating room care. What happened that led to this?
A patient&amp;mdash;we&amp;rsquo;ll call him Bill&amp;mdash;was a man in his late 50s who went to an ambulatory surgery center (ASC) for left shoulder arthroscopy (shoulder surgery) with rotator cuff repair.
Before the surgery began, the operating room (OR) team observed a surgical time-out or huddle.</description></item><item><title>Crisis center ignores signs of toxic lithium levels, cause brain damage in patient</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/crisis-center-ignores-signs-of-toxic-lithium-levels-cause-brain-damage-in-patient/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/crisis-center-ignores-signs-of-toxic-lithium-levels-cause-brain-damage-in-patient/</guid><description>A woman in her 40s went to a Texas crisis unit.

The Texas Department of Health and Human Services explains that a crisis unit is a respite unit where people deemed to have a low risk of harm to themselves or others can stay for as long as seven days. Although crisis units aren&amp;rsquo;t normal acute-care hospitals, they do have professional staff on hand to provide counseling and medication.</description></item><item><title>Pitocin causes excessive contractions, brain injury in baby</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/pitocin-causes-excessive-contractions-brain-injury-in-baby/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/pitocin-causes-excessive-contractions-brain-injury-in-baby/</guid><description>Obstetricians (OB/GYNs) sometimes recommend induction of labor when a pregnant woman reaches full term but hasn&amp;rsquo;t delivered her baby.
What is induction of labor?
Doctors and labor and delivery nurses induce labor by injecting Pitocin (a manufactured form of oxytocin) into an intravenous (IV) line. Pitocin causes the uterus to start contracting and often succeeds in getting active labor underway before it would&amp;rsquo;ve happened on its own.
Sometimes induction of labor is largely for convenience, but there are a variety of medical reasons why a physician may recommend it:</description></item><item><title>The nurse's role in medication safety</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-nurses-role-in-medication-safety/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-nurses-role-in-medication-safety/</guid><description>When I take the deposition of a registered nurse (RN), I often ask questions about the administration of medications.

Texas Board of Nursing Rule 217.11(1)(C) requires all nurses (not just RNs) to know the rationale for and the effects of medications and to correctly administer them.</description></item><item><title>Gabapentin linked to overdose deaths, medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/gabapentin-linked-to-overdose-deaths-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/gabapentin-linked-to-overdose-deaths-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>Gabapentin (Neurontin) is a frequently prescribed medication that has recently been in the news for causing serious complications and injuries even death.
FDA-approved uses
According to the U.S. Food &amp;amp; Drug Administration (FDA), gabapentin is indicated for two uses:
&amp;bull; Post-herpetic neuralgia in adults.
&amp;bull; Treatment of seizures. The product label lists warnings and precautions including drug reactions, anaphylaxis, driving impairment, somnolence/sedation, dizziness, and even suicidal thoughts.
Off-label uses
When the Neurontin patent expired in 2004, it became available as a generic medication called gabapentin.</description></item><item><title>Ativan and opioids are a risky duo</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/ativan-and-opioids-are-a-risky-duo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/ativan-and-opioids-are-a-risky-duo/</guid><description>Ativan (lorazepam) is a medication in a class of drugs called benzodiazepines.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Ativan to treat anxiety, sleep disturbances, and seizures. It&amp;rsquo;s also sometimes administered shortly before anesthesia.
Ativan overdoses
This common drug has been in the news from time to time over claims that it&amp;rsquo;s been involved in causing patients to commit self-harm or suicide. For example, in 2017, rock star Chris Cornell was found dead from suicide.</description></item><item><title>Lawsuit alleges Walgreens pharmacist gave man wrong prescription drug</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/lawsuit-alleges-walgreens-pharmacist-gave-man-wrong-prescription-drug/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/lawsuit-alleges-walgreens-pharmacist-gave-man-wrong-prescription-drug/</guid><description>There&amp;rsquo;s a CVS pharmacy down the street from our office. Day and night, that place stays busy. Chain and independent pharmacies in Texas and throughout the United States fill and dispense thousands of prescriptions every day.
Most of the time, the drug-filling process starts with an electronic prescription generated and transmitted by a physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner. Some prescriptions, though, begin with the patient delivering a paper prescription to the pharmacy.</description></item><item><title>4 questions you can ask to help avoid anesthesia malpractice in dental offices</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/4-questions-you-can-ask-to-help-avoid-anesthesia-malpractice-in-dental-offices/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/4-questions-you-can-ask-to-help-avoid-anesthesia-malpractice-in-dental-offices/</guid><description>Pediatric dental anesthesia is in the news again after a Houston district court jury awarded a verdict of nearly $100 million to the family of a brain-injured little girl named Nevaeh Hall.

This is a condition called deep vein thrombosis (DVT). DVTs most commonly develop in the veins of the calf or thigh.
The danger of DVTs happens if part of the blood clot breaks off. The traveling clot is called an embolism. More particularly, it&amp;rsquo;s called a pulmonary embolism if the dislodged blood clot reaches the lungs, where it can cause the deadly complication of disrupting blood flow to the lungs and heart.</description></item><item><title>Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and surgical risk</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/direct-oral-anticoagulants-doacs-and-surgical-risk/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/direct-oral-anticoagulants-doacs-and-surgical-risk/</guid><description>One of the important shared responsibilities that nurses, doctors, and patients have upon hospital admission is medication reconciliation. This is the process where a list of the patient&amp;rsquo;s existing medications is assembled and documented in the medical record.
It&amp;rsquo;s critical that patients provide a complete and accurate list to the nursing staff and physicians because this information is necessary to prevent drug-drug interactions, appropriately plan treatment, and to implement certain precautions.</description></item><item><title>Herpes simplex virus encephalitis treatment and medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/herpes-simplex-virus-encephalitis-treatment-and-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/herpes-simplex-virus-encephalitis-treatment-and-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>A recent opinion entered by the Amarillo Court of Appeals provides some interesting insights about the standard of care for treatment of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and encephalitis.

Of course, based on the nature of this interrogatory appeal, the defendant healthcare providers felt that the reports from plaintiff&amp;rsquo;s infectious diseases and neurology expert physicians failed to provide sufficient evidence about the allegations.</description></item><item><title>Errors in medication management are in 2020's top 10 list of most common sentinel/never events</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/errors-in-medication-management-are-in-2020s-top-10-list-of-most-common-sentinel/never-events/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/errors-in-medication-management-are-in-2020s-top-10-list-of-most-common-sentinel/never-events/</guid><description>The Joint Commission, the nation&amp;rsquo;s oldest healthcare accrediting organization, recently announced that errors in medication management was in the top 10 list of sentinel events in 2020.
Sentinel events are also called never events because they&amp;rsquo;re considered to be avoidable with proper policies, procedures, and staff training. When they occur, hospitals leaders must conduct a root cause analysis to find out what system and personnel failures led to the sentinel event, and what changes can be made to avoid them from harming future patients.</description></item><item><title>What you should know about pharmacy and medication errors</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-you-should-know-about-pharmacy-and-medication-errors/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-you-should-know-about-pharmacy-and-medication-errors/</guid><description>Study after study has found that some the most common causes of death in the United States are related to healthcare events. One is medication errors, accounting for 7,000 to 9,000 deaths a year.
As a former hospital administrator, it&amp;rsquo;s confounding to me that the healthcare industry can&amp;rsquo;t consistently correct this common mistake.
On the other hand, with nearly 7,000 prescription and over-the-counter drugs available in America, along with innumerable supplements, it&amp;rsquo;s foreseeable pharmacists and prescribers could encounter occasional problems.</description></item><item><title>Hyponatremia, managing sodium levels, and medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/hyponatremia-managing-sodium-levels-and-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/hyponatremia-managing-sodium-levels-and-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>Sodium is a natural electrolyte that must be kept in careful balance in our bodies because of its critical role in fluid balance.
Serum sodium is the laboratory test used to measure the level of sodium in the blood. Laboratories have a reference range for any test. For most labs, a normal serum sodium level is 135&amp;ndash;145 mEq/L. When a serum sodium is below 135 mEq/L, its abnormally low and is described by the diagnosis of hyponatremia.</description></item><item><title>Medication error temporarily paralyzes Houston patient, causes brain injury</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/medication-error-temporarily-paralyzes-houston-patient-causes-brain-injury/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/medication-error-temporarily-paralyzes-houston-patient-causes-brain-injury/</guid><description>Medication errors come in all shapes and sizes.
We&amp;rsquo;ve recently been working on a case where a major pharmacy chain dispensed and filled a prescription for a heart medication. The same bottle contained some pills for the correct medication that was ordered by the patient&amp;rsquo;s doctor and other pills that were a different medication. When the man took the medication, he became extremely dizzy and had an irregular heartbeat.

There are some health care mistakes that should never be made, though. They&amp;rsquo;re called sentinel events, or never events. Any time they occur, the standard of care requires a root cause analysis. A root cause analysis allows hospital leaders to figure out what went wrong and identify the root cause so the sentinel event won&amp;rsquo;t be repeated in the future.</description></item><item><title>Coumadin (warfarin) prescription, management, and medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/coumadin-warfarin-prescription-management-and-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/coumadin-warfarin-prescription-management-and-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>Coumadin generally
Coumadin (generic name warfarin) is a prescription drug that&amp;rsquo;s a blood thinner, or anticoagulant. Warfarin has been around since the 1940s and works by reducing the formation of blood clots.
Doctors frequently write long-term prescriptions for coumadin to prevent heart attacks, strokes, or other cardiovascular conditions.
Coumadin/warfarin use doesn&amp;rsquo;t come without risks, though. The most prominent risks are that it can decrease the body&amp;rsquo;s ability to stop internal bleeding and even cause death if the dosage is incorrect.</description></item><item><title>The peril of automatically blaming concerning signs and symptoms on narcotic medication effect</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-peril-of-automatically-blaming-concerning-signs-and-symptoms-on-narcotic-medication-effect/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-peril-of-automatically-blaming-concerning-signs-and-symptoms-on-narcotic-medication-effect/</guid><description>When a hospitalized patient is recovering from a surgery, there must be a careful balance between pain control and over-medication, which can mask signs and symptoms that there&amp;rsquo;s a serious complication.
Carefully monitoring how a patient responds to pain medications is a responsibility that is shared by surgeons, other physicians, and hospital nursing staff. While doctors write orders for pain medications, registered nurses are the ones who typically administer medications and continuously see what&amp;rsquo;s going on with the patient.</description></item><item><title>Under-staffing at pharmacies may lead to medication errors, danger to patients</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/under-staffing-at-pharmacies-may-lead-to-medication-errors-danger-to-patients/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/under-staffing-at-pharmacies-may-lead-to-medication-errors-danger-to-patients/</guid><description>A Texas pharmacist made an alarming admission in an anonymous letter to the Texas State Board of Pharmacy last year. The pharmacist wrote, &amp;ldquo;I am a danger to the public working for CVS.&amp;rdquo;
The anonymous letter went on to explain that CVS imposes an &amp;ldquo;absolutely dangerous&amp;rdquo; amount of busy work that pharmacists are expected to do on top of their principal concern of verifying prescriptions.
If this problem isn&amp;rsquo;t isolated, but instead is chain-wide, the risk to patients is staggering.</description></item><item><title>Opioid prescriptions, use, misuse, and medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/opioid-prescriptions-use-misuse-and-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/opioid-prescriptions-use-misuse-and-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>I recently spoke with a national reporter who called to ask some questions about the state of medical malpractice in Texas.

I quickly commented that, in my opinion, the Texas Medical Board is largely a worthless joke. I qualified my opinion by noting that there are a few types of matters that the Board takes seriously.
One of them, in my experience and opinion, is not the quality of care provided by Texas physicians.</description></item><item><title>Can supplements or medications injure a baby during pregnancy?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/can-supplements-or-medications-injure-a-baby-during-pregnancy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/can-supplements-or-medications-injure-a-baby-during-pregnancy/</guid><description>Pregnancy is a wonderful time of life for parents. Seeking early prenatal care with an OB/GYN physician is important to keep the mom and baby safe during pregnancy.
One of the important safety considerations during prenatal care is for the doctor to obtain a complete list of all prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, and supplements that the mom is taking.
Some medications and supplements are safe to take during pregnancy.

Around 130 people die in the United States daily after an opioid overdose. A significant chunk of that statistic comes from overdoses of prescription pain relievers and synthetic opioids like fentanyl. Around one fourth of chronic pain patients prescribed opioids misuse them and 8-12% of them become addicted.

Opioids are a highly-regulated class of powerful narcotic medications including painkillers like fentanyl, oxycodone, hydrocodone, codeine, and morphine.
Like their illegal cousin, heroin, prescription opioids are highly addictive and can get people hooked on them in as little as one dose.

This is the first step in a process that is called medication reconciliation.
At some doctor&amp;rsquo;s offices, clerks hand patients a stack of paperwork to fill out, burying the medication history form among them.

The FDA ordered safety labeling changes for these drugs because of risks that were uncovered under an FDA safety review.
