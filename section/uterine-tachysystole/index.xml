Electronic fetal monitoring equipment displays and prints two separate lines. The top line measures the fetal heart rate and the bottom line measures the mom’s uterine contractions. Well-trained labor and delivery registered nurses and OB/GYN (obstetrician) physicians can obtain a wealth of information by interpreting fetal monitoring strips.</description></item></channel></rss>
