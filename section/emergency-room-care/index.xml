When it comes to hospital emergency room (ER) care, some medical malpractice claims are downright impossible to pursue under existing law.
On January 12, 2024, the Texas Supreme Court entered an opinion to make it even harder for victims of medical malpractice in hospital emergency rooms to seek justice in Texas courtrooms.</description></item><item><title>Texas Mesenteric Ischemia Malpractice: When Negligence Has a Price</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-mesenteric-ischemia-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-mesenteric-ischemia-malpractice/</guid><description>Texas mesenteric ischemia medical malpractice cases revolve around the key issues of timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
Experienced Texas medical malpractice lawyers recognize the life-changing injury that patients face when they are diagnosed with ischemic bowel or bowel necrosis. When this happens because of the mistakes of a doctor, hospital, or nursing staff, a medical malpractice lawsuit can provide the resources needed to cover medical care, lost income, and to cope with the new reality.</description></item><item><title>Two Frequent Types of Heart Medical Negligence that Lawyers Encounter</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/two-types-heart-medical-negligence/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/two-types-heart-medical-negligence/</guid><description>Once again, heart disease ranked number one in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&amp;rsquo;s (CDC)â€¯annual list of causes of death in the United States.

He was a married electrical engineer with three children. As a child in Africa, he&amp;rsquo;d been diagnosed with sickle cell trait. Sickle cell trait is a condition where the person carries one sickle hemoglobin gene. It shouldn&amp;rsquo;t cause severe pain or big problems.
People with sickle cell disease, on the other hand, inherit sickle hemoglobin gene from both parents. It&amp;rsquo;s a serious condition where hemoglobin and the red blood cells that carry it are sickle shaped.</description></item><item><title>Sickle cell disease: Diagnosis, treatment, and medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/sickle-cell-disease-diagnosis-treatment-and-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/sickle-cell-disease-diagnosis-treatment-and-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>Sickle cell disease, or sickle cell anemia, is an inherited blood disease that impacts about 1 in 365 African Americans. Although it&amp;rsquo;s more common in the black community, sickle cell disease can affect people in any race or ethnic group.
What is sickle cell disease?
Red blood cells have iron-containing hemoglobin, which carry oxygen. They&amp;rsquo;re normally circular in shape.
When a person has sickle cell disease, there&amp;rsquo;s a distorted special type of hemoglobin, called hemoglobin S.</description></item><item><title>The secrets of resolving Texas emergency room medical malpractice cases</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-secrets-of-resolving-texas-emergency-room-medical-malpractice-cases/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-secrets-of-resolving-texas-emergency-room-medical-malpractice-cases/</guid><description>A Twitter connection recently sent me an interesting observation and question, &amp;ldquo;Amazing that you are advertising for ER cases in Texas with the &amp;lsquo;willful and wanton&amp;rsquo; standard of proof = gross negligence for ER cases.

According to recent reporting from National Public Radio, that&amp;rsquo;s the goal of private equity firms who are buying up emergency medicine practice groups. Private equity firms are investment partnerships that buy companies, reorganize them to generate more profit, and then resell them.

Some are impossible. With the right evidence, though, others can be pursued.
The reason for the challenging complexity lies in the Texas tort reform statute, Texas Civil Practice &amp;amp; Remedies Code Section 74.153. This law elevates the standard of proof required by hospital emergency room cases to willful and wanton negligence.
Texas appellate courts have interpreted that nonsensical phrase to be equivalent to gross negligence.</description></item><item><title>Texas doctors can't blame hospital policies for lack of proper medical care</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-doctors-cant-blame-hospital-policies-for-lack-of-proper-medical-care/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-doctors-cant-blame-hospital-policies-for-lack-of-proper-medical-care/</guid><description>The Austin Court of Appeals tackled an interesting legal issue on the effect of hospital policies on physician care.

A particular type of chest pain that concerns physicians is angina. Angina is a classic symptom of coronary artery disease (CAD). Many patients with angina describe the chest pain as pressure, heaviness, tightness, or squeezing sensation in the chest.
The American Heart Association (AHA)&amp;nbsp;explains that the current understanding of&amp;nbsp;chest pain requires an expansive definition.</description></item><item><title>Dallas $10+ million verdict shows that Texas tort reform didn't make all emergency room cases impossible</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/dallas-10-million-verdict-shows-that-texas-tort-reform-didnt-make-all-emergency-room-cases-impossible/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/dallas-10-million-verdict-shows-that-texas-tort-reform-didnt-make-all-emergency-room-cases-impossible/</guid><description>In Texas there&amp;rsquo;s a prevailing sentiment that hospital emergency room (ER) medical malpractice cases are simply unwinnable. It&amp;rsquo;s not only the public that feels that way&amp;mdash;I hear the same thing from many lawyers. That&amp;rsquo;s why many injured patients have a problem finding representation.
The reason for this involves a tort reform law that was enacted in Texas back in 2003. It creates a higher standard of proof for hospital emergency room cases called willful and wanton negligence.</description></item><item><title>Small bowel obstruction medical malpractice in Texas</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/small-bowel-obstruction-medical-malpractice-in-texas/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/small-bowel-obstruction-medical-malpractice-in-texas/</guid><description>A Texas emergency physician ended up in court as a defendant in a wrongful death medical malpractice case. The doctor responded by unsuccessfully asking the trial court to dismiss the case. When he lost there, the emergency physician took it to the El Paso Court of Appeals, which ruled that the case should go forward.

Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s happened to you. There&amp;rsquo;s an anxious, frantic awareness that something is terribly wrong and a struggle to get more air.
That&amp;rsquo;s what happened to &amp;ldquo;Vanderpump Rules&amp;rdquo; star LaLa Kent when she realized that her 18-month-old daughter was gasping for air like she couldn&amp;rsquo;t breathe. Kent rushed her to a packed hospital emergency room (ER).
Fortunately, the triage nurse, who&amp;rsquo;s responsible for deciding which patients need to be seen first, recognized the medical emergency and got her to a doctor quickly.</description></item><item><title>Emergency room boarding threatens patient safety</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/emergency-room-boarding-threatens-patient-safety/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/emergency-room-boarding-threatens-patient-safety/</guid><description>The physician chair of emergency medicine at a major East Coast academic medical center recently shared with me that his facility&amp;rsquo;s emergency department (ED) was over capacity.
Hospitals are licensed with a set number of staffed beds. By staffed that means a hospital should have adequate nursing and medical staff on duty to take care of patients assigned to its licensed beds.
The ED physician explained that his hospital has around 75 emergency room (ER) beds, all of which were full.</description></item><item><title>Spinal epidural abscess misdiagnosis causes paralysis</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/spinal-epidural-abscess-misdiagnosis-causes-paralysis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/spinal-epidural-abscess-misdiagnosis-causes-paralysis/</guid><description>A man in his 30s went to a Texas hospital emergency room (ER) three days in a row to be seen for back pain.

Michael was an active man who stayed busy with his family, work, and hobbies. His problem seemed to come out of the blue one day when Michael had mid-back (thoracic spine) pain.

Her comment got me thinking about how old school medical care is different than what’s touted as improved care today.

When a patient presents to a hospital with symptoms including chest pain, shortness of breath, and severe syncope (fainting), the triple rule out protocol comes into play. This constellation of symptoms requires a physical exam and testing, including a CT angiogram, to rule out or exclude three dangerous medical conditions:</description></item><item><title>At what stage of litigation must a plaintiff show willful and wanton negligence in a Texas emergency room malpractice case?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/at-what-stage-of-litigation-must-a-plaintiff-show-willful-and-wanton-negligence-in-a-texas-emergency-room-malpractice-case/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/at-what-stage-of-litigation-must-a-plaintiff-show-willful-and-wanton-negligence-in-a-texas-emergency-room-malpractice-case/</guid><description>Emergency room (ER) physicians, nurses, and other providers have a complex job.

A triage nurse is a registered nurse who uses a system called the emergency severity index (ESI) to decide and prioritize which patients need to be seen first by an ER physician.
Emergency rooms tend to be busy, so triage nurses perform a critical function.
Not everyone who shows up in an ER has an emergency medical condition.</description></item><item><title>A year and a half after ER doesn't inform patient of x-ray finding, man dies of cancer</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/a-year-and-a-half-after-er-doesnt-inform-patient-of-x-ray-finding-man-dies-of-cancer/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/a-year-and-a-half-after-er-doesnt-inform-patient-of-x-ray-finding-man-dies-of-cancer/</guid><description>A recent case shows why I think it&amp;rsquo;s important for patients to get a physical copy of any lab work, pathology study, or radiology tests ordered as a part of their healthcare.
