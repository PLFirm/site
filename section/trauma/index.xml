That can be up to $50,000 per patient&amp;mdash;that&amp;rsquo;s just the trauma activation fee and applies before any care is actually provided at the hospital.
From my perspective as a former hospital administrator, it seems that just about every hospital has become a trauma center.</description></item></channel></rss>
