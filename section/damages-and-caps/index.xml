When it comes to hospital emergency room (ER) care, some medical malpractice claims are downright impossible to pursue under existing law.
On January 12, 2024, the Texas Supreme Court entered an opinion to make it even harder for victims of medical malpractice in hospital emergency rooms to seek justice in Texas courtrooms.</description></item><item><title>Understanding how damages caps work in Texas medical malpractice cases</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/understanding-how-damages-caps-work-in-texas-medical-malpractice-cases/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/understanding-how-damages-caps-work-in-texas-medical-malpractice-cases/</guid><description>Damages caps are probably the part of Texas medical malpractice tort reform law that get more attention than any other. Yet, it still generates a lot of confusion and is worth discussing.
Not all damages are capped
The term damages refers to the categories of compensation that a plaintiff can seek at trial.
The most important thing to understand about damages caps in Texas medical malpractice cases is that not everything is capped.</description></item><item><title>Patient dies from nursing home fall despite documented high risk</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/patient-dies-from-nursing-home-fall-despite-documented-high-risk/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/patient-dies-from-nursing-home-fall-despite-documented-high-risk/</guid><description>A physician friend of mine recently commented on social media that, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m old enough to remember when surgeons would take patients to the OR [operating room] for appys [appendix removal surgery] or cholecystitis [gallbladder inflammation] based on the physical exam and history. I still love those old school surgeons.&amp;rdquo;
Her comment got me thinking about how old school medical care is different than what’s touted as improved care today. Some hospitals and facilities create systems that try and force physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and nurses to serve metrics and computers rather than the patients they&amp;rsquo;re supposed to be taking care of.</description></item><item><title>Jury holds orthopedic surgery group accountable in compartment syndrome case</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/jury-holds-orthopedic-surgery-group-accountable-in-compartment-syndrome-case/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/jury-holds-orthopedic-surgery-group-accountable-in-compartment-syndrome-case/</guid><description>Compartment syndrome is a dreaded condition that can happen develop after a broken bone.
What is compartment syndrome?
Different areas of the body are grouped together into compartments that are walled off by fascia and connective tissue. A serious injury in the lower leg, such as a broken bone, can cause bleeding and swelling within a compartment.&amp;nbsp;
Because the connective tissue walls of compartments are relatively rigid, thereâ€™s only so much room for expansion.</description></item><item><title>Texas Supreme Court defines how medical malpractice defendants must pay future health care expenses</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-supreme-court-defines-how-medical-malpractice-defendants-must-pay-future-health-care-expenses/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-supreme-court-defines-how-medical-malpractice-defendants-must-pay-future-health-care-expenses/</guid><description>The Texas Supreme Court issued a long-awaited opinion today regarding periodic payments in medical malpractice cases.

And what I mean by that is an opportunity to do things that you think you could not do before.
To tort reform aficionados in Texas, COVID-19 is a serious crisis that they didn&amp;rsquo;t want to waste without getting more tort reform on the book. And, as of June 1, 2021, it looks like they&amp;rsquo;ll be successful&amp;mdash;that&amp;rsquo;s when Senate Bill 6 went to the desk of Governor Greg Abbott, who almost certainly will sign it.</description></item><item><title>Houston court of appeals opinion gives roadmap for proving lost earnings in pediatric medical malpractice cases</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/houston-court-of-appeals-opinion-gives-roadmap-for-proving-lost-earnings-in-pediatric-medical-malpractice-cases/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/houston-court-of-appeals-opinion-gives-roadmap-for-proving-lost-earnings-in-pediatric-medical-malpractice-cases/</guid><description>While I find the practice of health law and medical malpractice to be interesting and rewarding, there&amp;rsquo;s one aspect that I really don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy:&amp;nbsp; Explaining to some injured and grieving families how Texas tort reform laws make their cases economically unviable to pursue despite serious injury or death being caused by legitimate medical malpractice.
The most significant insurmountable hurdle for some cases is the cap placed on non-economic damages. Non-economic damages include elements such as pain and suffering, mental anguish, disfigurement, and loss of consortium.</description></item><item><title>How to prove damages in a Texas medical malpractice cases</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-to-prove-damages-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-cases/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-to-prove-damages-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-cases/</guid><description>There are two major components of any Texas medical malpractice case, liability and damages. To have a successful case, the plaintiff needs both.
Liability refers to negligence. This means that the doctor, nurse, or hospital had an act or omission that violated the standard of care. The standard of care is what a reasonably prudent provider would have done under the same or similar circumstances.
Damages refers to the economic and non-economic injuries to the plaintiffs as a result of the negligence.</description></item><item><title>Some Texas nonprofit hospitals benefit from little-known $100,000 non-economic damages cap</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/some-texas-nonprofit-hospitals-benefit-from-little-known-100000-non-economic-damages-cap/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/some-texas-nonprofit-hospitals-benefit-from-little-known-100000-non-economic-damages-cap/</guid><description>Just when you think you&amp;rsquo;ve heard it all&amp;mdash;about Texas tort reform, of course&amp;mdash;there&amp;rsquo;s still more to think about.
Tort reform burdens for patients, generally
To recap on Texas medical malpractice tort reform generally, in 2003, the legislature and governor enacted new tort reform measures designed to dry up patient safety litigation. Among many other things, the Texas Medical Liability Act, Health &amp;amp; Safety Code Chapter 74:
&amp;bull; Requires plaintiffs to produce medical expert reports very early in the litigation.</description></item><item><title>How to prove mental anguish and pain and suffering in Texas medical malpractice cases</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-to-prove-mental-anguish-and-pain-and-suffering-in-texas-medical-malpractice-cases/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-to-prove-mental-anguish-and-pain-and-suffering-in-texas-medical-malpractice-cases/</guid><description>For many victims of medical malpractice, the worst problems that they must deal with are those that are tough to attach a dollar sign to. I&amp;rsquo;m talking about things like mental anguish and pain and suffering.
Under Texas law, these types of damages are lumped together in a category called non-economic damages. As result of the 2003 round of tort reform in Texas, non-economic damages are subject to caps.
No matter how severe a plaintiff&amp;rsquo;s mental anguish or pain and suffering may be, the maximum amount that can be recovered for all non-economic damages against any number of doctors or other human health care providers is $250,000.</description></item><item><title>Overcoming the challenges of proving loss of future earning capacity when you're under-employed or temporarily unemployed</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/overcoming-the-challenges-of-proving-loss-of-future-earning-capacity-when-youre-under-employed-or-temporarily-unemployed/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/overcoming-the-challenges-of-proving-loss-of-future-earning-capacity-when-youre-under-employed-or-temporarily-unemployed/</guid><description>In Texas, one of the critical factors influencing whether a medical malpractice case is viable or not is future earnings. The reason for this is the damages caps of Texas tort reform laws, which limit the amount of money recoverable in court for someone with low or no earnings versus someone who&amp;rsquo;s employed.
How does it impact a case when you&amp;rsquo;re underemployed? Before we tackle this important question, let&amp;rsquo;s tackle the basics of what you can recover in a medical malpractice case.</description></item><item><title>Is it possible to get punitive damages in a Texas medical malpractice lawsuit?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/is-it-possible-to-get-punitive-damages-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-lawsuit/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/is-it-possible-to-get-punitive-damages-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-lawsuit/</guid><description>Yes, a jury may award punitive damages, or exemplary damages as they&amp;rsquo;re called under Texas law, in a medical malpractice lawsuit. There are some tough standards in place, though, that must be met to support punitive damages.
What are punitive (exemplary) damages under Texas law?
Texas Civil Practice &amp;amp; Remedies Code Section 41.001(5) defines exemplary damages as any damages awarded as a penalty or punishment. Thus, exemplary or punitive damages aren&amp;rsquo;t considered economic or non-economic damages.</description></item><item><title>How do caps apply to what I can recover in a wrongful death medical malpractice lawsuit in Texas?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-do-caps-apply-to-what-i-can-recover-in-a-wrongful-death-medical-malpractice-lawsuit-in-texas/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-do-caps-apply-to-what-i-can-recover-in-a-wrongful-death-medical-malpractice-lawsuit-in-texas/</guid><description>Unfortunately, Texas victims of medical malpractice face the toughest, least fair caps on damages in America. With the lack of financial accountability that Texas hospitals and physicians have under so-called tort reform laws, there&amp;rsquo;s little wonder why Texas healthcare ranks near the bottom when it comes to patient safety.
In wrongful death medical malpractice cases, there are actually two separate caps that apply to every case.
The first cap, on non-economic damages, applies to every medical malpractice case in Texas courts.</description></item><item><title>How can liens impact a Texas medical malpractice settlement?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-can-liens-impact-a-texas-medical-malpractice-settlement/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-can-liens-impact-a-texas-medical-malpractice-settlement/</guid><description>I can&amp;rsquo;t think of a more dreaded topic for victims of medical malpractice than liens. That&amp;rsquo;s pretty remarkable, given the tort reform mania that&amp;rsquo;s plagued Texas for over 15 years.
When there&amp;rsquo;s a settlement or judgment resulting from medical malpractice, plaintiffs and their attorneys are required by law to protect certain interests of third parties.
As a Houston, Texas medical malpractice attorney, I find this unfair, but it&amp;rsquo;s something that we have to deal with.</description></item><item><title>How does the wrongful death cap work in a Texas medical malpractice lawsuit?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-does-the-wrongful-death-cap-work-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-lawsuit/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-does-the-wrongful-death-cap-work-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-lawsuit/</guid><description>When it comes to a wrongful death claim that&amp;rsquo;s related to medical malpractice, there are two different types of caps that you need to be aware of.
The first cap applies to all medical malpractice cases, whether a death is involved or not. Texas law imposes a cap on non-economic damages. Non-economic damages are those serious, yet intangible, injuries including pain-and-suffering, mental anguish, physical impairment, physical disfigurement, and even the loss of a loved one.</description></item><item><title>How does employment status factor into a Texas medical malpractice case?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-does-employment-status-factor-into-a-texas-medical-malpractice-case/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-does-employment-status-factor-into-a-texas-medical-malpractice-case/</guid><description>When it comes to medical malpractice cases, Texas law is extra-unfriendly to plaintiffs who are unemployed or retired.
Under current Texas tort reform laws, non-economic damages are capped. Non-economic damages are often the most significant damages to a plaintiff and include things like mental anguish, physical impairment, pain and suffering, and the loss of a relationship or consortium.
The amount of the non-economic damages depends on who is sued. If only physicians or other human-being healthcare providers are named as defendants in a medical malpractice lawsuit, the total non-economic damages cap is $250,000.</description></item><item><title>What you should know about the new Texas hospital lien law</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-you-should-know-about-the-new-texas-hospital-lien-law/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-you-should-know-about-the-new-texas-hospital-lien-law/</guid><description>Texas Governor Greg Abbott recently signed House Bill 2929 into law, which immediately changed the way hospital liens work in Texas.
When it comes to liens and subrogations, Texas law is unfriendly to negligence victims. When there&amp;#39;s a settlement because someone was injured by someone else&amp;#39;s carelessness, Texas law allows insurance companies to swoop in at the last minute and take a chunk of the recovery.
Hospital liens give hospitals certain authority to file a lien on any claim or cause of action that the patient has arising from someone else&amp;rsquo;s negligence.</description></item><item><title>Life care plans &amp; future medical care in brain &amp; birth injury &amp; catastrophic medical malpractice cases</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/life-care-plans-future-medical-care-in-brain-birth-injury-catastrophic-medical-malpractice-cases/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/life-care-plans-future-medical-care-in-brain-birth-injury-catastrophic-medical-malpractice-cases/</guid><description>When I meet with patients and families impacted by medical negligence, they&amp;rsquo;re often worried about how they&amp;rsquo;re going to make ends meet, pay medical bills, and get on with their lives.

The last two decades have seen major changes to the personal injury law landscape in Texas. In 2003, many medical malpractice cases became economically unfeasible overnight when new tort reform became effective.
Most significantly, the cap on past medical bills broadly impacted all types of personal injury cases.

There is not an absolute &amp;ldquo;tort reform&amp;rdquo; cap for medical malpractice cases
