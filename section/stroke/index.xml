I always think of that question when considering the complexity of stroke cases under Texas law. To adapt the phrase, one might ask, "How many legal traps can dance on the head of a pin?" That&amp;#39;s pretty much the state of stroke medical malpractice in Texas.
This article will cover some of the stroke traps and the narrow area where it may be possible to pursue a stroke medical malpractice case under existing Texas law.</description></item><item><title>HCA Houston Healthcare Northwest is now a comprehensive stroke center</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/hca-houston-healthcare-northwest-is-now-a-comprehensive-stroke-center/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/hca-houston-healthcare-northwest-is-now-a-comprehensive-stroke-center/</guid><description>HCA Houston Healthcare Northwest recently announced that it attained Comprehensive Stroke Certification from The Joint Commission, which is the nation&amp;rsquo;s oldest and largest healthcare accreditation organization.

Their observations are important because they know that person&amp;rsquo;s baseline, or normal behavior, which makes it easy for them to spot a change.
Physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and registered nurses, on the other hand, are often unfamiliar with their patients. When they don&amp;rsquo;t fully consider the history and information provided by patients and their friends and family members, it can lead to a misdiagnosis.</description></item><item><title>Delay in stroke treatment can cause speech problems, aphasia</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/delay-in-stroke-treatment-can-cause-speech-problems-aphasia/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/delay-in-stroke-treatment-can-cause-speech-problems-aphasia/</guid><description>I was surprised to see the word â€œstrokeâ€ trending on Twitter today, and then even more surprised to see it was because of witness testimony before the U.S. House January 6th Select Committee hearing.&amp;nbsp;

Academically, experts, professors, and students approach the science of decision-making from diverse disciplines including behavioral economics and social psychology.
Some research suggests that 60% of medical errors and malpractice claims involving hospital emergency rooms arise from failures. I think many of these errors are related to physician decision-making that bypasses the tested and true differential diagnosis process.</description></item><item><title>Posterior circulation stroke misdiagnosis and medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/posterior-circulation-stroke-misdiagnosis-and-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/posterior-circulation-stroke-misdiagnosis-and-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>Even with public education campaigns and the introduction of primary and comprehensive stroke centers in hospitals, there are still around 165,000 strokes per year that are misdiagnosed annually in United States emergency rooms.

Ischemic strokes

Although pretty much everyone has experienced headache,&amp;nbsp; when a doctor or healthcare provider hears a patient saying, &amp;ldquo;this is the worst headache of my life,&amp;rdquo; their ears should perk up.
Many medical and health professionals refer to this type of headache as a thunderclap headache. The descriptive name is accurate, describing an unusual headache that comes on as suddenly as a clap of thunder. Just like a thunderstorm can be a sign of danger, so, too, can a thunderclap headache be a sign of a life-threatening emergency medical condition.</description></item><item><title>Study explores new potential hemorrhagic stroke medical treatment</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/study-explores-new-potential-hemorrhagic-stroke-medical-treatment/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/study-explores-new-potential-hemorrhagic-stroke-medical-treatment/</guid><description>There are two different types of strokes, each with different time scopes and methods of treatment.
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), about 87% of strokes are ischemic, caused by blockage of blood flow to the brain. The remainder of strokes are hemorrhagic, caused by bleeding in the brain.
Most of the public&amp;rsquo;s attention is focused on the more common ischemic strokes. When people think of strokes they know that there&amp;rsquo;s a short time window to get to the hospital for treatment with the drug tPA, a clot-busting medication that dissolves clots and restores blood flow.</description></item><item><title>Myth buster: A negative CT scan doesn't necessarily mean that you're not having a stroke</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/myth-buster-a-negative-ct-scan-doesnt-necessarily-mean-that-youre-not-having-a-stroke/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/myth-buster-a-negative-ct-scan-doesnt-necessarily-mean-that-youre-not-having-a-stroke/</guid><description>There are two types of stroke, ischemic and hemorrhagic. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll focus on ischemic strokes.
Ischemic strokes
Ischemic strokes are by far and away the more common type, accounting for around 87% of all strokes. They&amp;rsquo;re caused when a clot blocks a blood vessel, either diminishing or cutting off blood supply to an area of the brain.
Ischemic strokes can be treated with the intravenous (IV) clot-busting drug called tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) within a window of 3 to 4.</description></item><item><title>Two common types of sleep apnea medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/two-common-types-of-sleep-apnea-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/two-common-types-of-sleep-apnea-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>When many people think of sleep apnea, the first thing that comes to mind may be snoring, or perhaps the inconvenience of a CPAP machine. Beyond these concerns, though, the most common type of sleep apnea, called obstructive sleep apnea, is a serious and potentially life-threatening medical condition.
Obstructive sleep apnea is a medical condition where the muscles of the throat and soft palate intermittently relax during sleep. When this happens, those anatomical structures drop and partially or fully obstruct the airway.</description></item><item><title>When does the willful and wanton standard of proof apply in Texas ER medical malpractice cases?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/when-does-the-willful-and-wanton-standard-of-proof-apply-in-texas-er-medical-malpractice-cases/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/when-does-the-willful-and-wanton-standard-of-proof-apply-in-texas-er-medical-malpractice-cases/</guid><description>Texas law treats medical malpractice lawsuits differently from other types of negligence cases. One of the significant differences is a heightened standard of proof in some types of claims.
Texas Civil Practice &amp;amp; Remedies Code Section 74.153 mandates a standard of proof called “willful and wanton negligence” for certain emergency medical care cases. If you’re confused by what that means, join the club. Willful conduct is inconsistent with any theory of negligence, but that discussion is for another day.</description></item><item><title>Subdural hematoma misdiagnosis in ER leads to aneurysm, brain injury</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/subdural-hematoma-misdiagnosis-in-er-leads-to-aneurysm-brain-injury/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/subdural-hematoma-misdiagnosis-in-er-leads-to-aneurysm-brain-injury/</guid><description>An interesting opinion out of the Dallas Court of Appeals dealt with a situation in which an emergency room doctor, nurse practitioner, and physician&amp;rsquo;s assistant allegedly contributed to the misdiagnosis of a patient with a brain bleed.

Primary care physicians or hospitalists frequently make referrals or order consultations to neurologists to work up potential issues.
The standard of care requires neurologists to make a careful evaluation of patients using a thorough physical exam and tests that show whether the patient has a normal neurological function. These tests include things such as carnial nerves, reflexes, motor strength movement, sensation, and balance.</description></item><item><title>New study reveals the best choice for post-hospital care after a stroke</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/new-study-reveals-the-best-choice-for-post-hospital-care-after-a-stroke/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/new-study-reveals-the-best-choice-for-post-hospital-care-after-a-stroke/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that stroke care gets a lot of attention in America, given that they&amp;#39;re so common.
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control &amp;amp; Prevention (CDC), around 800,000 people each year have a stroke in the United States. The large majority of these are first-time strokes, but almost one-fourth of them occur in people who&amp;rsquo;ve had one prior. There are two types of strokes. Nearly 90% are of the ischemic type, caused by a blood clot that blocks blood flow to the brain.</description></item><item><title>The three most common types of misdiagnosis</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-three-most-common-types-of-misdiagnosis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-three-most-common-types-of-misdiagnosis/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s frustrating to go to the doctor, urgent care, emergency room, or hospital with concerning symptoms only to be sent home after being told that nothing&amp;rsquo;s wrong.

As a Houston, Texas medical malpractice attorney, I&amp;rsquo;ve handled countless cases where this happened to my clients.

Everyone agrees that stroke care is time sensitive and that people should get to the emergency room (ER) at the first sign of trouble. Yet, those patients who make it to the ER with early symptoms that come and go are often discharged without much of a workup. This can lead to misdiagnosis, lack of treatment, a massive stroke, and a medical malpractice lawsuit.</description></item><item><title>Newborn strokes, cerebral palsy, and medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/newborn-strokes-cerebral-palsy-and-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/newborn-strokes-cerebral-palsy-and-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>Strokes are one of the causes of cerebral palsy in newborns that get little attention. Perinatal arterial ischemic stroke (PAIS) is the usual culprit, causing damage to part of the brain because of compromised blood flow in one of the major cerebral arteries.
The brain is such an important organ to the body that it requires an extensive network of blood vessels that supply it with oxygen and nourishment. The internal carotid arteries are major trunks that supply both sides of the brain.</description></item><item><title>Stroke diagnosis, misdiagnosis, and medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/stroke-diagnosis-misdiagnosis-and-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/stroke-diagnosis-misdiagnosis-and-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>United States hospitals have improved their performance in quickly treating acute ischemic stroke patients. Ischemic strokes account for nearly 90% of all strokes.
