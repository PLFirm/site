When it comes to hospital emergency room (ER) care, some medical malpractice claims are downright impossible to pursue under existing law.
On January 12, 2024, the Texas Supreme Court entered an opinion to make it even harder for victims of medical malpractice in hospital emergency rooms to seek justice in Texas courtrooms.</description></item><item><title>Unveiling White Rock Hospital's 1-Star Medicare Rating</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/white-rock-hospital-1-star-rating/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/white-rock-hospital-1-star-rating/</guid><description>The Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) a federal agency, recently named Baylor Scott &amp;amp; White Medical Center-White Rock, in Dallas, as one of the worst performing hospitals in America.&amp;nbsp;
The dubious 1-star ranking is based on 46 hospital quality measures that CMS uses to compare hospitals nationwide.
Only 248 hospitals nationwide received Medicare&amp;#39;s 1-star designation. This Dallas hospital was one of only seven hospitals in Texas to be named to Medicare&amp;#39;s 1-star list.</description></item><item><title>Data show a big difference between hospital and office anesthesia safety</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/data-show-a-big-difference-between-hospital-and-office-anesthesia-safety/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/data-show-a-big-difference-between-hospital-and-office-anesthesia-safety/</guid><description>Today&amp;#39;s healthcare consumers have more choices than ever before. When it comes to surgeries and procedures, patients have the option of having them done in an office setting or a hospital operating room. Patients also have the option of selecting a physician anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist to provide anesthesia care, although many facilities do not present it as a choice.
Why have a procedure in an office instead of a hospital operating room?</description></item><item><title>Respiratory therapist's notes shed light on why emergency room patient crashed</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/respiratory-therapists-notes-shed-light-on-why-emergency-room-patient-crashed/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/respiratory-therapists-notes-shed-light-on-why-emergency-room-patient-crashed/</guid><description>Respiratory therapists aren&amp;rsquo;t physicians or nurses. They&amp;rsquo;re specialized healthcare professionals who are trained and skilled in respiratory, airway, and cardiopulmonary care. They see patients in hospital emergency rooms (ERs), intensive care units (ICUs), and regular floors.
Perhaps because of this specialized focus, I&amp;rsquo;ve often found respiratory therapy notes to shed light on what really happened in patient care, when other documentation is suspicious, vague, or missing.
For example, we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a case involving a man in his 30s who was treated in a Dallas-area hospital ER for difficult breathing that he&amp;rsquo;d been experiencing for over a day.</description></item><item><title>Texas hospital hit with $40M+ verdict for allowing physician with license on probation to work at hospital</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-hospital-hit-with-40m-verdict-for-allowing-physician-with-license-on-probation-to-work-at-hospital/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-hospital-hit-with-40m-verdict-for-allowing-physician-with-license-on-probation-to-work-at-hospital/</guid><description>A Texas hospital settled a medical malpractice claim for $9 million instead of appealing a $43 million jury verdict in favor a patient. We&amp;rsquo;ll call the patient Bill.
Bill was experiencing pain because of gallstones and went to the hospital for treatment. A gastroenterologist physician saw him. We&amp;rsquo;ll call him Dr. Smith.
According to the medical malpractice lawsuit, Bill needed a surgery called ERCP, or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. ERCP is a specialized procedure performed by gastroenterology physicians to explore and fix problems with the bile system and pancreatic ducts.</description></item><item><title>HCA Houston Healthcare Pearland gets 1-star Medicare rating for 2022</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/hca-houston-healthcare-pearland-gets-1-star-medicare-rating-for-2022/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/hca-houston-healthcare-pearland-gets-1-star-medicare-rating-for-2022/</guid><description>HCA Houston Healthcare Pearland is the only hospital in the Houston area that Medicare dinged with a 1-star rating in 2022.
Medicare releases an annual list of star ratings for hospitals nationwide. It&amp;rsquo;s a results and data-focused program that reminds me of the saying &amp;ldquo;if it isn&amp;rsquo;t measured, it isn&amp;rsquo;t done.&amp;rdquo;
How does Medicare rank hospitals?
The Medicare program ranks hospitals based on their performance in five areas. The bottom-performing hospitals nationwide, based on these measures, are given 1-star ratings.</description></item><item><title>New study highlights the risks of hospital care</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/new-study-highlights-the-risks-of-hospital-care/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/new-study-highlights-the-risks-of-hospital-care/</guid><description>One of the scariest things about healthcare is that healthcare itself isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly safe.
For decades, studies have shown that hospital, medical, and nursing mistakes are major factors in patient outcomes.
Recently, I was working with some experts in a case involving an elderly man who fell at home and hit his head. Let&amp;rsquo;s call him Jerry. When Jerry&amp;rsquo;s wife saw that he had a head laceration and a little bleeding, she decided to take him to a hospital emergency room (ER).</description></item><item><title>Federal inspectors find multiple facilities with no nurses on site for extending periods of time</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/federal-inspectors-find-multiple-facilities-with-no-nurses-on-site-for-extending-periods-of-time/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/federal-inspectors-find-multiple-facilities-with-no-nurses-on-site-for-extending-periods-of-time/</guid><description>One of the most basic responsibilities of hospitals and nursing homes is to provide an adequate staff of competent registered nurses. Yet, time after time when we speak with new clients, we&amp;rsquo;re told stories of how nurses are nowhere to be found.
While I typically use the phrase nowhere to be found metaphorically, recent reporting by USA Today reveals that it sometimes applies literally.
Federal guidelines require nursing homes to have a registered nurse on duty.</description></item><item><title>ER nurses escorted out of hospital after raising understaffing, patient safety concerns</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/er-nurses-escorted-out-of-hospital-after-raising-understaffing-patient-safety-concerns/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/er-nurses-escorted-out-of-hospital-after-raising-understaffing-patient-safety-concerns/</guid><description>One of my favorite professional qualities and traditions of registered nurses is nursing advocacy. Advocacy requires nurses to exercise critical thinking to identify situations that are unsafe for patients and to speak up to get action.
When we discuss nursing advocacy, it&amp;rsquo;s typically in the context of a medical malpractice lawsuit, when nurses didn&amp;rsquo;t do what they should have done.
For example, just today I was working with an emergency nursing expert witness in a case where the absence of nursing advocacy contributed to a tragic outcome for our client.</description></item><item><title>The nurse's role in medication safety</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-nurses-role-in-medication-safety/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-nurses-role-in-medication-safety/</guid><description>When I take the deposition of a registered nurse (RN), I often ask questions about the administration of medications. Nurses and their attorneys often try the &amp;ldquo;Nuremberg defense&amp;rdquo; of &amp;ldquo;I was just following orders,&amp;rdquo; but in reality, nurses owe their patients a higher level of care.
Texas Board of Nursing Rule 217.11(1)(C) requires all nurses (not just RNs) to know the rationale for and the effects of medications and to correctly administer them.</description></item><item><title>Houston Methodist charges almost double for a surgery than the cost at a nearby academic hospital</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/houston-methodist-charges-almost-double-for-a-surgery-than-the-cost-at-a-nearby-academic-hospital/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/houston-methodist-charges-almost-double-for-a-surgery-than-the-cost-at-a-nearby-academic-hospital/</guid><description>According to the focus group research, the number one reason that people select a hospital is location. Not quality. Not whether you&amp;rsquo;ll be seen by a physician as opposed to a physician assistant (PA) or nurse practitioner (NP). Not even cost. Location.
I believe some of this phenomenon is because of the lack of information available to consumers. Most hospitals advertise that they offer top-notch care. Texas law allows hospitals to conceal the credentials and performance reviews of their physicians.</description></item><item><title>Why hospitals keep physicians and providers with lots of bad outcomes</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/why-hospitals-keep-physicians-and-providers-with-lots-of-bad-outcomes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/why-hospitals-keep-physicians-and-providers-with-lots-of-bad-outcomes/</guid><description>Before I went to law school, I was a hospital administrator. When I think back to those years, I recall meetings. Lots of meetings.
Hospitals have numerous committees. Quality improvement. Accreditation. Peer review. Whatever the name, the overarching purpose of hospital committees is to improve patient safety in some shape or form.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I found the news about a hospital hiring an independent, external review of its cardiac surgery program so interesting.</description></item><item><title>Hospitalized patients are particularly at risk during this time period</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/hospitalized-patients-are-particularly-at-risk-during-this-time-period/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/hospitalized-patients-are-particularly-at-risk-during-this-time-period/</guid><description>The Joint Commission, a healthcare accrediting agency, describes hand-off communications as the transfer and acceptance of patient care between physicians, providers, or nurses.
Hand-off communications happen thousands of times every day. There should be a handoff communication every time a nurse changes shifts or a new attending or resident physician rotates onto a service.
As a former hospital administrator, I recall this topic coming up frequently. Registered nurses can be diligent about tending to a patient during the whole shift, only to drop the ball when care is transferred to a new nurse.</description></item><item><title>Patient dies from nursing home fall despite documented high risk</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/patient-dies-from-nursing-home-fall-despite-documented-high-risk/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/patient-dies-from-nursing-home-fall-despite-documented-high-risk/</guid><description>A physician friend of mine recently commented on social media that, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m old enough to remember when surgeons would take patients to the OR [operating room] for appys [appendix removal surgery] or cholecystitis [gallbladder inflammation] based on the physical exam and history. I still love those old school surgeons.&amp;rdquo;
Her comment got me thinking about how old school medical care is different than what’s touted as improved care today. Some hospitals and facilities create systems that try and force physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and nurses to serve metrics and computers rather than the patients they&amp;rsquo;re supposed to be taking care of.</description></item><item><title>Painter Law Firm secures $1,700,000 settlement in bariatric weight loss surgery medical malpractice claim</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/painter-law-firm-secures-1700000-settlement-in-bariatric-weight-loss-surgery-medical-malpractice-claim/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/painter-law-firm-secures-1700000-settlement-in-bariatric-weight-loss-surgery-medical-malpractice-claim/</guid><description>In January of this year, a woman in her 50s called Painter Law Firm to ask this question: Can I sue my bariatric surgeon?

That sums up the practice approach of some surgeons, who are eager to operate on patients even when they donâ€™t need a surgery.&amp;nbsp;

This is the precise issue presented in a class action lawsuit that was recently filed against two neurosurgeons.</description></item><item><title>Patient reassessment is a key physician and nursing responsibility</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/patient-reassessment-is-a-key-physician-and-nursing-responsibility/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/patient-reassessment-is-a-key-physician-and-nursing-responsibility/</guid><description>One of the key responsibilities of doctors and nurses is reassessing their patients.
When a physician or nurse sees a patient for the first time in a hospital or facility setting, the standard of care requires a thorough assessment. For attending physicians and bedside nurses, this will be a thorough head-to-toe assessment. For consulting specialists, it may be a focused assessment on relevant body parts or systems.
Patient assessment isn&amp;rsquo;t a once and done procedure.</description></item><item><title>Who's responsible for the negligence of temporary or travel nurses?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/whos-responsible-for-the-negligence-of-temporary-or-travel-nurses/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/whos-responsible-for-the-negligence-of-temporary-or-travel-nurses/</guid><description>The COVID-19 situation has raised to the surface a longer-term problem with nursing staffing and compensation.
For years, many have felt that nursing morale has been damaged by nurses being overworked, underpaid, and having to deal with chronic inadequate staffing&amp;mdash;and these were problems before anyone even heard of COVID.
Then along came the virus. Hospitals got slammed with unprecedented surges of patients needing care. To meet the demand, the market rate for temporary nursing positions (also called travel nurses, agency nurses, or locum tenens nurses) surged.</description></item><item><title>Without assessment and prevention, it doesn't take long for a hospitalized patient to get a pressure wound</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/without-assessment-and-prevention-it-doesnt-take-long-for-a-hospitalized-patient-to-get-a-pressure-wound/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/without-assessment-and-prevention-it-doesnt-take-long-for-a-hospitalized-patient-to-get-a-pressure-wound/</guid><description>Patients go to the hospital for medical help, not to get a new injury.

Physical therapists tout the very real benefits of post-operative physical therapy, including:
&amp;bull; Restoring or improving mobility and flexibility
&amp;bull; Helping with balance
&amp;bull; Building strength
&amp;bull; Reducing swelling and pain
&amp;bull; Reducing formation of scar tissue with tissue mobilization techniques
In some situations, though, physical therapists can become overly aggressive in rushing to start physical therapy too early, before it&amp;rsquo;s safe for the patient to do so.</description></item><item><title>Houston's St. Joseph Medical Center: Will capital investment improve quality of care and patient safety?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/houstons-st.-joseph-medical-center-will-capital-investment-improve-quality-of-care-and-patient-safety/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/houstons-st.-joseph-medical-center-will-capital-investment-improve-quality-of-care-and-patient-safety/</guid><description>St. Joseph Medical Center recently announced a significant investment of $92 million to upgrade its facilities and equipment.

The reason for this is if something goes wrong, outpatient facilities don&amp;rsquo;t have the emergency equipment, supplies, and personnel on hand that hospitals do.
In fact, in case after case that I&amp;rsquo;ve handled involving an outpatient facility or surgery center, the first thing they do when there&amp;rsquo;s a problem is call 911 to get the patient to a hospital immediately.</description></item><item><title>Barebone nurse staffing levels cause medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/barebone-nurse-staffing-levels-cause-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/barebone-nurse-staffing-levels-cause-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>I recently took the deposition of a registered nurse with over 25 years of experience at a major hospital in Houston&amp;rsquo;s Texas Medical Center. She was assigned to care for a post-surgical patient who experienced a complication during his back surgery called an incidental durotomy.
An incidental durotomy occurs when there is accidental damage, laceration, or puncturing of the protective covering of the spinal cord. It places patients at increased risk for leaking cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and can cause neurological symptoms including a headache that can be uncontrollable if the person isn&amp;rsquo;t lying completely flat.</description></item><item><title>Houston medical malpractice lawsuit: Radiologist, two hospitalists, and surgeon at Pasadena's Bayshore Medical Center misdiagnose volvulus</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/houston-medical-malpractice-lawsuit-radiologist-two-hospitalists-and-surgeon-at-pasadenas-bayshore-medical-center-misdiagnose-volvulus/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/houston-medical-malpractice-lawsuit-radiologist-two-hospitalists-and-surgeon-at-pasadenas-bayshore-medical-center-misdiagnose-volvulus/</guid><description>Painter Law Firm filed a new medical malpractice lawsuit on behalf of a client against four physicians involved with our client&amp;rsquo;s care at Bayshore Medical Center.

The standard of care has changed, though, and now discourages OB/GYN doctors from routinely performing episiotomies.

Who is responsible for nursing malpractice?
In Texas, nurses are almost always employed by hospitals. The standard of care requires hospitals to make sure that its nurses are competent to provide the care that they are assigned to handle. This includes an obligation to provide ongoing training to nurses, as well as annual assessments and documentation of each nurse&amp;rsquo;s competencies.</description></item><item><title>X-rays and CT scans: Radiation risk and malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/x-rays-and-ct-scans-radiation-risk-and-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/x-rays-and-ct-scans-radiation-risk-and-malpractice/</guid><description>In most of the cases that I handle, in my career as a Houston, Texas medical malpractice lawyer, patients have had some type of radiology study. It could be an x-ray, CT scan, MRI scan, or other study.
While radiology studies are often helpful when it comes to diagnosing a patient, there is an increasing debate in the medical community about the over-use and reliance on imaging. The concern is that doctors should not order radiology studies when it is possible to make a diagnosis without them.</description></item><item><title>Baylor Scott &amp; White Medical Centerâ€”Hillcrest Waco medical malpractice lawyer/attorney</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/baylor-scott-white-medical-center%C3%A2hillcrest-waco-medical-malpractice-lawyer/attorney/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/baylor-scott-white-medical-center%C3%A2hillcrest-waco-medical-malpractice-lawyer/attorney/</guid><description>As a Texas medical malpractice lawyer based in Houston, I handle medical negligence and wrongful death cases all over the state.

Texas is home to more freestanding emergency rooms than any other state in America. You probably have seen them before&amp;mdash;they are popping up in strip malls and neighborhoods all over Houston. They are called &amp;ldquo;freestanding&amp;rdquo; because they are not connected to a hospital.
Regardless of whether a patient goes to a hospital emergency room or a freestanding ER, there is an expectation of being treated by a trained emergency physician.</description></item><item><title>The danger of medical device misconnections</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-danger-of-medical-device-misconnections/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-danger-of-medical-device-misconnections/</guid><description>As a Houston, Texas medical malpractice lawyer, I have represented a number of patients who are seriously injured by having a medication administered the wrong way.

When reviewing medical records in our lawsuits, I frequently encounter medication errors, which I believe are caused by healthcare providers speeding through their work without taking safety precautions.

Undocumented healthcare
When Painter Law Firm files medical malpractice or wrongful death lawsuits on behalf of our clients, the defendant doctors or nurses often claim to have provided care that is not documented in the medical records.

When a patient goes to see a physician in an emergency room, clinic, or office, the standard of care requires the physician to use the differential diagnosis process.
This involves the doctor listening to the signs, symptoms, and complaints of the patient, and then assembling a list of every potential diagnosis that could explain them.</description></item><item><title>Baptist Beaumont Hospital medical malpractice lawyer/attorney</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/baptist-beaumont-hospital-medical-malpractice-lawyer/attorney/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/baptist-beaumont-hospital-medical-malpractice-lawyer/attorney/</guid><description>Baptist Beaumont Hospital is a private hospital located at 3080 College Street, Beaumont, TX 77701.

It is a 312-bed hospital that advertises itself as a regional referral hospital offering services including emergency care, cardiology, orthopedics, sports medicine, women&amp;rsquo;s services, neurology, oncology, and primary and general medicine.</description></item><item><title>Two risks concerning critical lab values and your doctor</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/two-risks-concerning-critical-lab-values-and-your-doctor/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/two-risks-concerning-critical-lab-values-and-your-doctor/</guid><description>As a Houston, Texas medical malpractice attorney, I have handled a lot of cases where critical lab values were not handled properly, resulting in serious injury or death of patients.
A critical lab value is potentially life-threatening and needs immediate attention by a clinical physician. Yet, all too often the laboratory results are reported back in a routine fashion, with no sense of urgency. In recent years, researchers have devoted a significant amount of attention to this problem, in the hope of improving patient safety and outcomes.</description></item><item><title>Strokes in children and young adults are frequently misdiagnosed</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/strokes-in-children-and-young-adults-are-frequently-misdiagnosed/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/strokes-in-children-and-young-adults-are-frequently-misdiagnosed/</guid><description>As a Houston, Texas medical malpractice lawyer, I have represented and filed lawsuits on behalf of clients who suffered life-changing injuries because of a misdiagnosed stroke.
Tough legal standards for stroke malpractice cases
Every time that I meet with a potential stroke malpractice client, I advised them up-front about the significant differences between medical and legal standards when it comes to strokes.
In the medical community, stroke experts agree that the clot-busting drug tPA should be given as soon as possible within 3.</description></item><item><title>Three ways to research a Texas doctor or hospital's quality of care</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/three-ways-to-research-a-texas-doctor-or-hospitals-quality-of-care/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/three-ways-to-research-a-texas-doctor-or-hospitals-quality-of-care/</guid><description>Even in this age where consumers are able to research everything online, when it comes to doctors and hospitals, a lot of information is off-limits.
Even though federal and Texas laws require hospitals to have quality improvement and assurance programs, including peer review of care that is provided, those same laws designate this information as privileged and not available for public disclosure.
In April 2017, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services proposed that private hospital accreditation organizations&amp;mdash;which handle oversight for nearly 9 out of 10 hospitals&amp;mdash;be required to publicly disclose problems that they identified during inspections of hospitals and other facilities, in addition to the steps that were being taken to fix them.</description></item><item><title>Two tips to make the transfer from a hospital to a nursing or rehabilitation facility safer</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/two-tips-to-make-the-transfer-from-a-hospital-to-a-nursing-or-rehabilitation-facility-safer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/two-tips-to-make-the-transfer-from-a-hospital-to-a-nursing-or-rehabilitation-facility-safer/</guid><description>As a Texas lawyer who focuses on handling medical malpractice cases for patients, I often have the opportunity to see health care trends and common errors that harm patients.
One of the most dangerous time periods for patient safety, in my experience, is any time that there is a transition in care. This includes things like changing nursing shifts, moving from the intensive care unit to the floor, and discharge from a hospital to a nursing or rehabilitation facility.</description></item><item><title>Some surgeons work in two operating rooms at the same time</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/some-surgeons-work-in-two-operating-rooms-at-the-same-time/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/some-surgeons-work-in-two-operating-rooms-at-the-same-time/</guid><description>Multi-tasking is popping up everywhere, some of it is good, but in other instances it is dangerous.
For instance, Texas is one of the few states where it is legal to &amp;ldquo;text and drive.&amp;rdquo; I hardly ever drive for more than a few minutes without seeing drivers weave in and out of traffic lanes because they are busy looking at mobile phone screens. I am happy that a law will go into effect later this year that imposes some restrictions on this dangerous multi-tasking behavior.</description></item><item><title>When doctors and nurses settle on the wrong diagnosis, it is hard to get their attention</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/when-doctors-and-nurses-settle-on-the-wrong-diagnosis-it-is-hard-to-get-their-attention/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/when-doctors-and-nurses-settle-on-the-wrong-diagnosis-it-is-hard-to-get-their-attention/</guid><description>As a Houston medical malpractice attorney, I have handled many cases over the years where doctors, nurses, and hospitals treat one medical problem after a car wreck or other traumatic accident, but entirely miss other medical problems.

Some complications occur despite quality care.
Other complications happen because a surgeon, doctor, or nurse is negligent or makes a mistake.
In my years of helping clients who have been seriously injured during a surgery, I have met a number of people who went to the operating room for surgery on one part of the body and came out with a new injury to an entirely separate part of the body.</description></item><item><title>Some hospitals are set up to allow physician medication errors</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/some-hospitals-are-set-up-to-allow-physician-medication-errors/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/some-hospitals-are-set-up-to-allow-physician-medication-errors/</guid><description>When the government encouraged, and later forced, hospitals to transition to electronic medical records, one of the big selling points was that they would reduce medication errors. Now that electronic medical records systems are widely used at hospitals all over Texas and nationwide, experts agree that they have had little to no impact on reducing adverse drug events in hospitals.

Most surgeons are in a race to see more and more patients every day in order to maintain their income level, which has taken a hit because of Medicare and insurance cuts. To that end, surgeons and their practice groups frequently hire mid-level providers to assist with the workload.</description></item><item><title>Comparing care at teaching hospitals to non-teaching hospitals</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/comparing-care-at-teaching-hospitals-to-non-teaching-hospitals/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/comparing-care-at-teaching-hospitals-to-non-teaching-hospitals/</guid><description>In May 2017, the Journal of the American Medical Association published the results of a study looking into the difference in outcomes between patients admitted to major teaching hospitals, versus patients admitted to minor teaching hospitals or non-teaching hospitals.

Even though every surgery carries certain risks, few people expect that they will be ones to experience a new illness, complication, or even death from the procedure.

Hi, I&amp;#39;m Robert Painter. Today I want to talk to you about brain injuries, and one specific tip on how you can avoid brain injuries during a hospitalization.
There are a lot of ways we can injure our heads or experience a brain injury. It could be in a football game - getting a concussion. I&amp;#39;ve had clients who have fallen off horses. But something that I&amp;#39;ve seen happen with an increasing frequency over the last few years would be people who are patients in a hospital doing fine recovering, but they end up having a brain injury because of the nursing and doctor care.</description></item><item><title>Video: Brachial plexus injuries/Erb's Palsy from birth</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/video-brachial-plexus-injuries/erbs-palsy-from-birth/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/video-brachial-plexus-injuries/erbs-palsy-from-birth/</guid><description>Video transcript:
Hi Robert Painter, and today we are going to be talking about a birth injury called Erb&amp;#39;s palsy, or also known as a brachial plexus injury.
Now the brachial plexus refers to a bundle of nerves that is found in on both sides of our bodies, really in the armpit area. Now during the birth process those nerves can get injured, and those can have devastating effects because the brachial plexus takes care of the motor, or the movement, function, in our arms, as well as the in sensation we have in this whole area - and even into the chest to some extent.</description></item><item><title>Video: Holiday seasons see an increase in dangerous hospital errors</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/video-holiday-seasons-see-an-increase-in-dangerous-hospital-errors/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/video-holiday-seasons-see-an-increase-in-dangerous-hospital-errors/</guid><description>With the holiday season upon us there are two things I want to talk to you about today that can keep you and your family safe when it comes to hospitalizations.
Number one, if you can avoid a hospitalization during the holiday season, you should do it as much as possible.

That certainly seems how it goes in our family. Did you know, though, that during these times the risk of medical and nursing errors in the hospital is much higher than normal?
If possible, avoid hospitals on weekends, evenings and holidays

It usually happens like this.
A doctor orders some lab work or a radiological study, like a CT scan or MRI. After the results are in, a nurse, lab tech or radiology tech does not information the physician who ordered the study. When the results are critical, this means that precious time is lost when the physician remains in the dark and cannot order life-saving treatment.</description></item><item><title>Hyponatremia after a head injury can cause brain damage or death</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/hyponatremia-after-a-head-injury-can-cause-brain-damage-or-death/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Nov 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/hyponatremia-after-a-head-injury-can-cause-brain-damage-or-death/</guid><description>Any time I hear about someone who has had a head trauma in a car wreck I find myself concerned about sodium, of all things.

Session after session, the Texas legislature has failed to amend it despite a terrible controversy over the provisions governing end-of-life care.
As it stands now, hospital committees, not patients and their families, have the ultimate say-so in whether a person receives curative care, food and water&amp;mdash;in other words, they make the &amp;#39;life and death&amp;#39; decision.
Plus, the due process provisions of the law are dubious: (1) Hospitals only need to give a patient and family 48-hours&amp;#39; notice of the committee meeting.</description></item><item><title>Instead of pointing fingers at each other, doctors and nurses need to focus on patient care and safety</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/instead-of-pointing-fingers-at-each-other-doctors-and-nurses-need-to-focus-on-patient-care-and-safety/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/instead-of-pointing-fingers-at-each-other-doctors-and-nurses-need-to-focus-on-patient-care-and-safety/</guid><description>Study after study has shown that one of the biggest contributors to medical errors and negligence is poor communication among healthcare providers.

Many Texans are surprised to learn that the Advance Directives Act of 1999 allows a hospital committee to act as a &amp;#39;death panel&amp;#39; that can override a patient or family&amp;#39;s treatment wishes, even to the point of withholding care, treatment, food and water from a patient.</description></item><item><title>Medicare: 1 in 7 patients is harmed during hospitalization</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/medicare-1-in-7-patients-is-harmed-during-hospitalization/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/medicare-1-in-7-patients-is-harmed-during-hospitalization/</guid><description>According to a new report by the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, about 15,000 Medicare patients per month experience a complication or error while hospitalized that contributes to death.

Physicians perform assessments and make orders, and most often then delegate it to the nursing staff to monitor the patient, follow the orders, and report back when there are any changes in the patient&amp;rsquo;s status.
For nurses to be able to fulfill this role, hospitals must be serious about their role to hire only qualified nurses and then to use proper testing and assessment to ensure that those nurses have the skills to take care of particular types of patients.</description></item><item><title>Painter Law Firm wins medical malpractice settlement of $3,925,000</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/painter-law-firm-wins-medical-malpractice-settlement-of-3925000/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jun 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/painter-law-firm-wins-medical-malpractice-settlement-of-3925000/</guid><description>Painter Law Firm attorney Robert Painter recently settled a Houston medical malpractice lawsuit for $3,925,000.

The balance of power between patients and physicians about end-of-life health care decisions has seesawed over the years. The development of "advance directives," led to a nationwide shift in favor of patients. Advance directives allow patients the opportunity to convey end-of-life decisions prior to a need arising. In Texas, these patient rights have diminished as legislators focus on development and implementation of the futility review process that authorizes health-care providers to have the final say under certain circumstances.</description></item><item><title>Death panels already exist</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/death-panels-already-exist/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jan 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/death-panels-already-exist/</guid><description>This op-ed was published in the August 19, 2009 edition of The Washington Times.
