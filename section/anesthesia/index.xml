It’s important for the nursing staff to keep a close eye on patients during the immediate post-operative period, because of potential complications including cervical hematoma and angioedema. These dangerous conditions are distinct, but share overlapping like respiratory distress, and require fast diagnosis and treatment to avoid dire consequences.</description></item><item><title>When Anesthesia Goes Wrong: A Texas Attorney's Guide to Medical Malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/anesthesia-texas-attorney-guide/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/anesthesia-texas-attorney-guide/</guid><description>As a Texas litigation attorney focusing on handling medical malpractice cases for plaintiffs, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen firsthand the devastating impact of negligence in the operating room, particularly when it comes to the administration of general anesthesia. This article aims to shed light on common issues surrounding medical negligence involving general anesthesia and the legal implications for affected patients and their families.
Understanding General Anesthesia Anesthesiologist physicians and certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) administer general anesthesia medications to induce a state of controlled unconsciousness, essential for many surgical procedures.</description></item><item><title>Data show a big difference between hospital and office anesthesia safety</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/data-show-a-big-difference-between-hospital-and-office-anesthesia-safety/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/data-show-a-big-difference-between-hospital-and-office-anesthesia-safety/</guid><description>Today&amp;#39;s healthcare consumers have more choices than ever before. When it comes to surgeries and procedures, patients have the option of having them done in an office setting or a hospital operating room. Patients also have the option of selecting a physician anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist to provide anesthesia care, although many facilities do not present it as a choice.

Common types of obstetric anesthesia
For vaginal or natural deliveries, obstetric anesthesiologists and CRNAs often use an&amp;nbsp;epidural&amp;nbsp;for pain control. Epidural anesthesia is delivered by a catheter that&amp;rsquo;s inserted into the epidural space of the mother&amp;rsquo;s spine usually near the T10&amp;ndash;L1 level. It&amp;rsquo;s usually a continuous infusion of anesthetic medication until after the baby is delivered.</description></item><item><title>Questions to ask on whether ambulatory surgery center is appropriate for a patient</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/questions-to-ask-on-whether-ambulatory-surgery-center-is-appropriate-for-a-patient/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/questions-to-ask-on-whether-ambulatory-surgery-center-is-appropriate-for-a-patient/</guid><description>Ambulatory surgery centers are now a popular option for a large variety of procedures and surgeries.
In the past, patients had the sole option of going to a hospital operating room. Ambulatory or outpatient surgery centers were opened as an alternative to hospitals for low-risk patients having low-risk surgeries. More recently, though, ambulatory surgery centers have accepted higher-risk patients who were having more complex procedures.
From what we&amp;rsquo;ve learned from clients, some Texas surgeons and ambulatory surgery centers don&amp;rsquo;t spend much, if any time, discussing the added risks of having surgery outside a hospital setting.</description></item><item><title>Texas jury awards $21 million over nurse anesthetist (CRNA) operating room care that left 27-year-old man with brain injury</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-jury-awards-21-million-over-nurse-anesthetist-crna-operating-room-care-that-left-27-year-old-man-with-brain-injury/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-jury-awards-21-million-over-nurse-anesthetist-crna-operating-room-care-that-left-27-year-old-man-with-brain-injury/</guid><description>A Dallas County, Texas jury returned a verdict of $21 million in favor of a 27-year-old patient who was injured by anesthesia care provided by a certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA) at Baylor University Medical Center.
What is a CRNA?
CRNAs are advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs), meaning they are registered nurses with graduate-level training in nursing anesthesia.
Are CRNAs supervised by a doctor?
Under Texas law, CRNAs must be medically directed or supervised by a physician.</description></item><item><title>Lawsuit alleged CRNA caused botched esophageal intubation, patient death</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/lawsuit-alleged-crna-caused-botched-esophageal-intubation-patient-death/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/lawsuit-alleged-crna-caused-botched-esophageal-intubation-patient-death/</guid><description>When it comes to an airway emergency, there&amp;rsquo;s no time to waste. Some circumstances require immediate placement of a breathing (endotracheal) tube into the patient&amp;rsquo;s trachea (windpipe) to secure the airway. This is a medical procedure called intubation.
Anesthesiologists are physicians who are airway experts. Sometimes an anesthesiologist is in the operating room (OR) providing anesthesia care. Other times, the hands-on OR anesthesia care is provided by a non-physician certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA).</description></item><item><title>The most common avoidable errors in claims against certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs)</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-most-common-avoidable-errors-in-claims-against-certified-registered-nurse-anesthetists-crnas/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-most-common-avoidable-errors-in-claims-against-certified-registered-nurse-anesthetists-crnas/</guid><description>I recently came across an interesting article in the American Association of Nurse Anesthesiology (AANA) Journal that explored at preventable acts of medical malpractice involving certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs).
What are nurse anesthetists?
Some people may be unfamiliar with the field of nurse anesthesiology or certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs). CRNAs are registered nurses with additional graduate-level training in the nursing administration and management of anesthesia, including general anesthesia during surgery.</description></item><item><title>Texas Medical Board suspends Dallas anesthesiologist for allegedly tampering with IV bags</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-medical-board-suspends-dallas-anesthesiologist-for-allegedly-tampering-with-iv-bags/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-medical-board-suspends-dallas-anesthesiologist-for-allegedly-tampering-with-iv-bags/</guid><description>An anesthesiologist from the Dallas Metroplex area is under federal and state investigation over allegations that he tampered with IV (intravenous) bags at Baylor Scott &amp;amp; White Surgicare North Dallas.

This involves inserting a flexible endotracheal tube down the patientâ€™s throat into the trachea, or airway.
In some situations, and anesthesiologist or certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA) will intubate a patient as part of administration of general anesthesia for surgery. This is typically done in a planned, controlled environment.&amp;nbsp;
In these circumstances, the standard of care requires a pre-anesthesia assessment, which includes planning for proper management of patients with difficult airways.</description></item><item><title>Outpatient surgery centers are different from hospital operating rooms</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/outpatient-surgery-centers-are-different-from-hospital-operating-rooms/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/outpatient-surgery-centers-are-different-from-hospital-operating-rooms/</guid><description>Ambulatory surgery centers are increasingly popular alternatives to hospital-based outpatient surgeries. Most surgeries, by the way, are outpatient surgeries, rather than requiring a hospital admission.
According to the Texas Ambulatory Surgery Center Society, the first surgery center in the United States opened in 1970. There are over 5,300 ambulatory surgery centers today nationwide, and 430 in Texas alone. In some states, there are more surgery centers than hospitals. A majority of all outpatient surgeries in America are now performed in an ambulatory surgery center.</description></item><item><title>New guidelines for anesthesiologists address emergency planning for difficult airway patients</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/new-guidelines-for-anesthesiologists-address-emergency-planning-for-difficult-airway-patients/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/new-guidelines-for-anesthesiologists-address-emergency-planning-for-difficult-airway-patients/</guid><description>An anesthesiologist shared an experience on Twitter.

Anesthesiologists are physicians with significant classroom and clinical training on how to safely sedate or anesthetize patients for procedures. Their training includes critical care and airway management.
The standard of care requires anesthesiologists to perform a pre-anesthesia assessment on patients before anesthetic medication is administered.</description></item><item><title>Texas certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA) loses legal challenge against physician experts</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-certified-registered-nurse-anesthetist-crna-loses-legal-challenge-against-physician-experts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-certified-registered-nurse-anesthetist-crna-loses-legal-challenge-against-physician-experts/</guid><description>Certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) are back in the Texas medical malpractice headlines.

Scope creep
This important study weighed into the intense debate over what some have called scope creep. As a former hospital administrator, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen scope creep in these areas:
&amp;bull; Some advanced practice nurses, such as certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) and nurse practitioners (NPs), and physician assistants (PAs) want to expand their scope of practice to what&amp;rsquo;s traditionally been reserved for physicians or anesthesiologists (physicians with anesthesia clinical residency training)</description></item><item><title>Patient dies under CRNA care, Texas court rejects expert report from anesthesiologist</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/patient-dies-under-crna-care-texas-court-rejects-expert-report-from-anesthesiologist/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/patient-dies-under-crna-care-texas-court-rejects-expert-report-from-anesthesiologist/</guid><description>When Texas legislators passed the Texas Medical Liability Act, of tort reform statute, I doubt they contemplated situations where medical records were virtually completely silent about health care that led to serious injury or death.

One challenge is that when patients are placed under general anesthesia, they have no idea what&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp; happened in their care until they wake up, usually in the recovery room.
For instance, patients might think they know the answers to these questions before being wheeled off to the OR, but could be wrong:</description></item><item><title>Esophageal perforation management and medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/esophageal-perforation-management-and-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/esophageal-perforation-management-and-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>Esophageal perforation is a dreaded rare complication of surgeries and procedures involving the neck.
What is the esophagus?
The esophagus is a muscular tube for the transport of food and liquids from the throat to the gastrointestinal tract. It&amp;rsquo;s located anterior (in front of) the spinal column and posterior (behind) the trachea, or windpipe.
How can the esophagus get perforated in the operating room?
Medical studies report that esophageal perforation has occurred in procedures including anterior cervical spine surgery, endoscopy (placement of a flexible scope with camera down the throat), and during intubation or extubation (placing or removing, respectively, an endotracheal tube down the throat for general anesthesia).</description></item><item><title>Boy's death highlights risks of dental sedation</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/boys-death-highlights-risks-of-dental-sedation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/boys-death-highlights-risks-of-dental-sedation/</guid><description>As a father of four children, I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine what the family of a three-year-old boy is going through following the death of their son from a routine dental procedure.

Beyond these concerns, though, the most common type of sleep apnea, called obstructive sleep apnea, is a serious and potentially life-threatening medical condition.
Obstructive sleep apnea is a medical condition where the muscles of the throat and soft palate intermittently relax during sleep. When this happens, those anatomical structures drop and partially or fully obstruct the airway.</description></item><item><title>When does the willful and wanton standard of proof apply in Texas ER medical malpractice cases?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/when-does-the-willful-and-wanton-standard-of-proof-apply-in-texas-er-medical-malpractice-cases/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/when-does-the-willful-and-wanton-standard-of-proof-apply-in-texas-er-medical-malpractice-cases/</guid><description>Texas law treats medical malpractice lawsuits differently from other types of negligence cases. One of the significant differences is a heightened standard of proof in some types of claims.
Texas Civil Practice &amp;amp; Remedies Code Section 74.153 mandates a standard of proof called “willful and wanton negligence” for certain emergency medical care cases. If you’re confused by what that means, join the club. Willful conduct is inconsistent with any theory of negligence, but that discussion is for another day.</description></item><item><title>Why is a proper pre-anesthesia evaluation so important?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/why-is-a-proper-pre-anesthesia-evaluation-so-important/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/why-is-a-proper-pre-anesthesia-evaluation-so-important/</guid><description>Anesthesiologists are physicians with specialized training to put people asleep or render them unconscious during surgery. Certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) are nurses, rather than physicians, with additional training to perform similar tasks.
Anesthetic medications have a powerful impact on the whole body. In the operating room, anesthesia providers play the critical role of monitoring and protecting life functions and vital organs, including the brain, heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, endocrine system, skin integrity, and nervous system, from the stress of anesthesia and surgery.</description></item><item><title>The three most common types of anesthesiology medical malpractice in Texas</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-three-most-common-types-of-anesthesiology-medical-malpractice-in-texas/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-three-most-common-types-of-anesthesiology-medical-malpractice-in-texas/</guid><description>In my view, anesthesiology is one of the most demanding medical specialties. Anesthesiologists put patients to sleep so they can&amp;rsquo;t experience pain, but they can&amp;rsquo;t over-sedate them without risking being able to bring them back.
Unfortunately, the practice of anesthesia medicine has gone in the wrong direction. Insurance companies, lobbyists, and others have pushed for increasing rights and recognitions for lesser-trained nurse anesthetists. In fact, in Texas, these certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) largely run the show in most operating rooms (ORs), with one anesthesiologist in the hallway supervising the work of up to five CRNAs in five different operating rooms at once.</description></item><item><title>The risks of dental general anesthesia for patients with sleep apnea</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-risks-of-dental-general-anesthesia-for-patients-with-sleep-apnea/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-risks-of-dental-general-anesthesia-for-patients-with-sleep-apnea/</guid><description>Sleep apnea is a significant risk factor that must be taken into account any time a patient receives general anesthesia.
There are different types of sleep apnea, but the most dangerous one is obstructive sleep apnea. As the name suggests, with this type of sleep apnea, the affected person&amp;rsquo;s upper airway becomes obstructed multiple times while sleeping. When the airway is obstructed, breathing and oxygenation temporarily stop, which can cause a disruption of sleep and plummeting levels of oxygen in arterial blood.</description></item><item><title>Research shows that surgery centers aren't as safe as hospital operating rooms</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/research-shows-that-surgery-centers-arent-as-safe-as-hospital-operating-rooms/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/research-shows-that-surgery-centers-arent-as-safe-as-hospital-operating-rooms/</guid><description>USA Today reports that over 60% of all surgeries, operations, and procedures are now being handled at independent surgery centers, rather than hospitals.

Office-based versus hospital operating rooms

The anesthesia plan reflects that administering anesthesia to a patient is serious business.

These days, anesthesia is so common that it&amp;rsquo;s hard to imagine even getting a tooth filled without it.

While most of us tend to take anesthesia for granted these days, it certainly doesn&amp;rsquo;t come without risks. That&amp;rsquo;s why a thorough pre-anesthesia assessment is part of the standard of care and is critical to the safety of the patient facing the surgery requiring general anesthesia.

The idea behind cardiac clearance is to assess a patient&amp;rsquo;s risk of a cardiovascular event occurring during the surgery and what interventions and plans can be made to manage them. If a serious heart condition is uncovered, the elective surgery will be delayed or canceled so the life-threatening cardiac issues can be addressed.</description></item><item><title>New Houston appellate opinion rules against anesthesiologist in expert report dispute</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/new-houston-appellate-opinion-rules-against-anesthesiologist-in-expert-report-dispute/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/new-houston-appellate-opinion-rules-against-anesthesiologist-in-expert-report-dispute/</guid><description>The First Court of Appeals in Houston entered a new opinion in a medical malpractice case that will hopefully discourage frivolous motions to dismiss filed by healthcare defendants early in litigation.

On December 14, 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that it &amp;ldquo;is warning that repeated or lengthy use of general anesthetic and sedation drugs during surgeries or procedures in children younger than 3 years or in pregnant women during their third trimester may affect the development of children&amp;rsquo;s brains.</description></item><item><title>Three things that you can do to reduce the serious risks of anesthesia</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/three-things-that-you-can-do-to-reduce-the-serious-risks-of-anesthesia/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/three-things-that-you-can-do-to-reduce-the-serious-risks-of-anesthesia/</guid><description>Whether it is given in a hospital operating room, doctor&amp;rsquo;s office, or dentist&amp;rsquo;s office, general anesthesia presents serious risks. As a Texas medical malpractice lawyer, I frequently get called by patients and families who have been seriously injured, or worse, as a result an anesthesia mishap.
Just recently, a family called about the tragic death of a husband and father. It all started with a bout of food poisoning that was so bad that it caused blood clots to form in both of his legs.</description></item><item><title>Dental procedures are riskier than you may think</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/dental-procedures-are-riskier-than-you-may-think/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/dental-procedures-are-riskier-than-you-may-think/</guid><description>As Texas medical malpractice lawyer, I have represented clients who have suffered serious injuries at the hands of dentists.
Let&amp;rsquo;s face it. No one enjoys going to the dentist. For most people, though, that is because a trip to a dental office is viewed as an inconvenient time of discomfort, rather than a risky undertaking that could result in permanent injury, or worse.
There are two major types of injuries that I have seen from dental or oral surgery treatment.</description></item><item><title>Surgery &amp; operating room malpractice: Are the doctors in the room?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surgery-operating-room-malpractice-are-the-doctors-in-the-room/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surgery-operating-room-malpractice-are-the-doctors-in-the-room/</guid><description>Do you ever feel like a number rather than a person when you go to a doctor&amp;rsquo;s office or hospital? If so, you are not alone. Many people feel that medicine has lost its focus on healing, in exchange for a rush to push as many patients through the revolving door as possible every day.

It is your chance to make sure that you truly understand the risks versus benefits of the proposed treatment or procedure, as well as who will actually be involved with your care.
In many hospitals around Texas, informed consent is treated as a check-the-box exercise with little thought or discussion.</description></item><item><title>Memorial Hermann Southeast Hospital anesthesia team overdoses Propofol, causing death of 45-year-old woman</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/memorial-hermann-southeast-hospital-anesthesia-team-overdoses-propofol-causing-death-of-45-year-old-woman/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Mar 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/memorial-hermann-southeast-hospital-anesthesia-team-overdoses-propofol-causing-death-of-45-year-old-woman/</guid><description>Attorney Robert Painter&amp;nbsp;filed a wrongful death medical malpractice lawsuit against Memorial Hermann Southeast Hospital, and an anesthesiologist and certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA) who work at the hospital, concerning the needless death of 45-year-old Michelle Hunt.
