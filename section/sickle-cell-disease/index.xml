He was a married electrical engineer with three children. As a child in Africa, he&amp;rsquo;d been diagnosed with sickle cell trait. Sickle cell trait is a condition where the person carries one sickle hemoglobin gene. It shouldn&amp;rsquo;t cause severe pain or big problems.
People with sickle cell disease, on the other hand, inherit sickle hemoglobin gene from both parents. It&amp;rsquo;s a serious condition where hemoglobin and the red blood cells that carry it are sickle shaped.</description></item></channel></rss>
