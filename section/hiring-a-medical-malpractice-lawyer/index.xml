When it comes to hospital emergency room (ER) care, some medical malpractice claims are downright impossible to pursue under existing law.
On January 12, 2024, the Texas Supreme Court entered an opinion to make it even harder for victims of medical malpractice in hospital emergency rooms to seek justice in Texas courtrooms.</description></item><item><title>Texas Supreme Court reviewing medical malpractice statute of limitations</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-supreme-court-reviewing-medical-malpractice-statute-of-limitations/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-supreme-court-reviewing-medical-malpractice-statute-of-limitations/</guid><description>The Texas Supreme Court has granted the petition to review the 20-year-old medical malpractice tort reform statute because the intermediate appellate courts disagree on how to apply it.
Texas Civil Practice &amp;amp; Remedies Code Section 74.051 requires a medical malpractice plaintiff to serve a notice of claim on all defendants at least 60 days before filing a lawsuit. A valid notice of claim must include a comprehensive, executed statutory authorization for the release of healthcare information, which is codified at Section 74.</description></item><item><title>How Texas medical malpractice plaintiffs are paid for future medical expenses after winning at trial</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-texas-medical-malpractice-plaintiffs-are-paid-for-future-medical-expenses-after-winning-at-trial/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-texas-medical-malpractice-plaintiffs-are-paid-for-future-medical-expenses-after-winning-at-trial/</guid><description>The Texas Supreme Court recently released a long-awaited opinion that addresses practical issues for the periodic payment statute that applies to any jury award of future medical expenses. The case is styled Virlar v. Puente; No. 20-092, and you can read the opinion here.
The big picture on future medical expenses
In catastrophic medical malpractice cases, the largest element of damages is typically future medical expenses. When a patient develops a brain injury because of health care negligence, for example, he or she can require around-the-clock care that can cost millions of dollars over the patient&amp;rsquo;s life expectancy.</description></item><item><title>The role of an autopsy in Texas wrongful death medical malpractice cases</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-role-of-an-autopsy-in-texas-wrongful-death-medical-malpractice-cases/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-role-of-an-autopsy-in-texas-wrongful-death-medical-malpractice-cases/</guid><description>Under Texas law, an autopsy should be performed if a patient dies within 24 hours after admission to the hospital. (Texas Statutes Art. 49.25, Sect. 6).&amp;nbsp;
What is an autopsy?
An autopsy is a forensic examination of a body after death, generally by a physician trained in pathology. Generally, an autopsy will include:
&amp;bull; External examination of the body
&amp;bull; Internal examination of the body, including organs and vasculature
&amp;bull; Toxicology and lab work</description></item><item><title>Proving a Texas ER medical malpractice case</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/proving-a-texas-er-medical-malpractice-case/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/proving-a-texas-er-medical-malpractice-case/</guid><description>Under Texas law, hospital emergency room medical malpractice cases are tough. Some are impossible. With the right evidence, though, others can be pursued.
The reason for the challenging complexity lies in the Texas tort reform statute, Texas Civil Practice &amp;amp; Remedies Code Section 74.153. This law elevates the standard of proof required by hospital emergency room cases to willful and wanton negligence.
Texas appellate courts have interpreted that nonsensical phrase to be equivalent to gross negligence.</description></item><item><title>Surveillance video evidence in medical malpractice cases</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surveillance-video-evidence-in-medical-malpractice-cases/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surveillance-video-evidence-in-medical-malpractice-cases/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s hard to imagine something happening in a public place where there&amp;rsquo;s no video recording. In civil rights cases, videos are sometimes the most important evidence.
In medical malpractice cases, video evidence can also be a game changer, but there&amp;rsquo;s often only a short time window when it can be obtained. If you go into any hospital, clinic, or professional building, there are likely numerous video cameras recording. Many camera systems, though, are programmed to record over old videos in a set time, often as little as 30 days.</description></item><item><title>Understanding how damages caps work in Texas medical malpractice cases</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/understanding-how-damages-caps-work-in-texas-medical-malpractice-cases/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/understanding-how-damages-caps-work-in-texas-medical-malpractice-cases/</guid><description>Damages caps are probably the part of Texas medical malpractice tort reform law that get more attention than any other. Yet, it still generates a lot of confusion and is worth discussing.
Not all damages are capped
The term damages refers to the categories of compensation that a plaintiff can seek at trial.
The most important thing to understand about damages caps in Texas medical malpractice cases is that not everything is capped.</description></item><item><title>FAQ: When does a medical mistake amount to medical malpractice in Texas?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/faq-when-does-a-medical-mistake-amount-to-medical-malpractice-in-texas/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/faq-when-does-a-medical-mistake-amount-to-medical-malpractice-in-texas/</guid><description>One of the most common questions we hear from potential clients at Painter Law Firm is whether a bad outcome amounts to medical malpractice or is legally actionable.
While news of a poor result or complication isn&amp;rsquo;t welcomed by anyone, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean that a hospital, physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or registered nurse did anything wrong. On the other hand, just because the informed consent paperwork lists things that could potentially go wrong with a treatment or surgery doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that a bad outcome isn&amp;rsquo;t medical malpractice.</description></item><item><title>How the discovery rule works for Texas medical malpractice cases</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-the-discovery-rule-works-for-texas-medical-malpractice-cases/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-the-discovery-rule-works-for-texas-medical-malpractice-cases/</guid><description>One of the most common questions that we receive from potential clients is whether the discovery rule applies to their case. This is invariably an interesting and complex question.
Before getting into what the discovery rule is and how it applies under Texas law to medical malpractice cases, we should first address why it&amp;rsquo;s even a thing. In three words: statute of limitations.
Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations is a law that defines how much time a party has to file a lawsuit.</description></item><item><title>3 reasons you may not want to wait and see what happens after a surgical complication</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/3-reasons-you-may-not-want-to-wait-and-see-what-happens-after-a-surgical-complication/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/3-reasons-you-may-not-want-to-wait-and-see-what-happens-after-a-surgical-complication/</guid><description>When a patient experiences a surgical complication, it&amp;rsquo;s common for the surgeon to advise allowing some time for the body to heal and return to normal.
This isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily bad advice, but there are definitely some other considerations to keep in mind. In fact, in some situations, waiting can create other problems down the line.
Taking medical and surgical options off the table

I remember playing basketball way back in high school, and that was the players&amp;rsquo; sentiment toward referee calls.
In contrast to a basketball court, Texas courts don&amp;rsquo;t take this approach when it comes to medical malpractice plaintiffs complying with tort reform gate-keeping measures. That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s so important for injured patients to hire an attorney with significant experience in handling Texas medical malpractice lawsuits.</description></item><item><title>Wrongful death medical malpractice claims are different in Texas</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/wrongful-death-medical-malpractice-claims-are-different-in-texas/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/wrongful-death-medical-malpractice-claims-are-different-in-texas/</guid><description>When a patient dies from medical malpractice in Texas, it&amp;rsquo;s sometimes possible to bring a wrongful death claim.
Whether there&amp;rsquo;s a viable wrongful death claim depends on the specific facts of the patient and surrounding circumstances. A top-rated, experienced Texas medical malpractice attorney can help you determine whether a wrongful death claim can be made.

When a person is already incapacitated, by definition they lack the capacity to sign a power of attorney, medical power of attorney, or will.

A primer on Texas tort reform
Before getting into this year&amp;rsquo;s amendment, let&amp;rsquo;s briefly revisit how medical malpractice tort reform works in Texas. Broadly speaking, there are two functions. First, there is a gatekeeper role to prevent or discourage certain types of cases from making it to the jury.</description></item><item><title>Texarkana court of appeals tackles sufficiency of plaintiff's medical expert opinion</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texarkana-court-of-appeals-tackles-sufficiency-of-plaintiffs-medical-expert-opinion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texarkana-court-of-appeals-tackles-sufficiency-of-plaintiffs-medical-expert-opinion/</guid><description>The 6th Court of Appeals, in Texarkana, Texas, recently entered an opinion regarding the sufficiency of a medical expert report challenged by the defense.

The eggshell skull rule is a common law principle applicable in tort cases.

Take, for example, a person who has a skull that&amp;rsquo;s as fragile as an eggshell.

With the advent of electronic medical records, new issues emerged in medical record analysis. Electronic medical records are easy to read because they&amp;rsquo;re typewritten, but perhaps 75% of a typical patient chart is regurgitated or repeated text from prior injuries.

Whether Chapter 74 applies to a particular case requires a factually-specific analysis that&amp;rsquo;s unique to that case.

Liability refers to negligence. This means that the doctor, nurse, or hospital had an act or omission that violated the standard of care. The standard of care is what a reasonably prudent provider would have done under the same or similar circumstances.
Damages refers to the economic and non-economic injuries to the plaintiffs as a result of the negligence.</description></item><item><title>Willful and wanton negligence standard applies to some Texas labor and delivery medical malpractice cases</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/willful-and-wanton-negligence-standard-applies-to-some-texas-labor-and-delivery-medical-malpractice-cases/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/willful-and-wanton-negligence-standard-applies-to-some-texas-labor-and-delivery-medical-malpractice-cases/</guid><description>As the long-awaited year of 2021 has arrived, I&amp;rsquo;ve looked back on some of the more interesting medical malpractice opinions from Texas appellate courts.

Because of the complexity and cost of medical malpractice cases, almost all of them are handled on a contingency basis.

An experienced Texas medical malpractice lawyer begins the research and investigation into potential liens and subrogation interests long before mediation or settlement.

Doctors feel the stress of high overhead expenses while haggling with health insurance companies and Medicare to get paid for medical and healthcare services rendered. In contrast, doctors offering in-house medical spa services enjoy the instant profits from cash-paying customers with little additional expense.
Aestheticians (also spelled estheticians) have less training than typical employees and doctors&amp;rsquo; offices and, therefore, are less expensive to hire.</description></item><item><title>The roles of the guardian ad litem and structured settlement in a Texas medical malpractice case involving a minor</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-roles-of-the-guardian-ad-litem-and-structured-settlement-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-case-involving-a-minor/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-roles-of-the-guardian-ad-litem-and-structured-settlement-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-case-involving-a-minor/</guid><description>When there&amp;rsquo;s a settlement in a Texas medical malpractice case involving only adults, getting the case wrapped up and funded is straightforward.

What&amp;rsquo;s the elephant?

I&amp;rsquo;m talking about things like mental anguish and pain and suffering.
Under Texas law, these types of damages are lumped together in a category called non-economic damages. As result of the 2003 round of tort reform in Texas, non-economic damages are subject to caps.
No matter how severe a plaintiff&amp;rsquo;s mental anguish or pain and suffering may be, the maximum amount that can be recovered for all non-economic damages against any number of doctors or other human health care providers is $250,000.</description></item><item><title>Hospital administration, nursing supervisor negligence can cause patient injuries</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/hospital-administration-nursing-supervisor-negligence-can-cause-patient-injuries/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/hospital-administration-nursing-supervisor-negligence-can-cause-patient-injuries/</guid><description>In my experience, medical malpractice cases typically involve mistakes by more than one healthcare provider. In other words, it&amp;rsquo;s often the case that one medical error isn&amp;rsquo;t enough to seriously injure the patient. It usually requires multiple mistakes by multiple defendants.
This reminds me of our representation of a client in a medical malpractice suit against Plano, Texas neurosurgeon Christopher Duntsch, M.D. Dr. Duntsch was involved in several serious medical malpractice and wrongful death lawsuits in the Dallas area at once.</description></item><item><title>Are hospitals responsible for the medical malpractice of doctors under Texas law?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/are-hospitals-responsible-for-the-medical-malpractice-of-doctors-under-texas-law/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/are-hospitals-responsible-for-the-medical-malpractice-of-doctors-under-texas-law/</guid><description>Our potential and existing clients at Painter Law Firm commonly ask who is responsible for the conduct of doctors, nurses, techs, and other healthcare providers.
Physicians generally aren&amp;rsquo;t hospital employees
There is an old, bizarre principle in Texas law called the corporate practice of medicine act. It specifies that only doctors, not corporations or other entities, can practice medicine. Therefore, hospitals cannot employ physicians.
If you think about it, it&amp;rsquo;s really a sweetheart deal for hospitals.</description></item><item><title>Never events, wrong-side surgery, and medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/never-events-wrong-side-surgery-and-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/never-events-wrong-side-surgery-and-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>There&amp;rsquo;s a term used by hospital risk managers and leaders called a &amp;ldquo;never event.&amp;rdquo; The Joint Commission, an organization that accredits most hospitals, refers to never events as &amp;ldquo;sentinel events.&amp;rdquo;
Whatever they&amp;rsquo;re called, never or sentinel events are errors by a hospital, physician, nurse, or laboratory that are so serious that they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t ever happen.

Near the top of my list is the discovery stay created by Texas Civil Practice &amp;amp; Remedies Code Chapter 74.
One of the benefits of filing a lawsuit is the ability to conduct discovery. Discovery is the process where one party can force another party to answer questions under oath or produce documents.

We&amp;rsquo;ve heard multiple mediators say that 85&amp;ndash;90 percent of claims settle before trial, and that&amp;#39;s in line with what we&amp;nbsp;have seen.
Most of the time, in our experience, when a plaintiff settles the case it&amp;rsquo;s with all defendants. Medical malpractice lawsuits frequently have multiple defendants, which could include hospitals, doctors, or other healthcare providers.
Sometimes, though, plaintiffs settle a case with some defendants and try the case against the remaining healthcare providers.</description></item><item><title>When your medical records leave out information, you can fill in the blanks</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/when-your-medical-records-leave-out-information-you-can-fill-in-the-blanks/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/when-your-medical-records-leave-out-information-you-can-fill-in-the-blanks/</guid><description>Here at Painter Law Firm, we regularly speak with victims of medical malpractice who are upset and worried that their medical records aren&amp;rsquo;t accurate or have a lot of missing information.

Whenever it&amp;rsquo;s possible, though, we prefer to file them in federal courts.
Texas law presents some undesirable challenges to medical malpractice claims filed in state court.
One hurdle is a requirement set by Texas Civil Practice &amp;amp; Remedies Code Section 74.351. The plaintiff (patient) in a medical malpractice suit must serve one or more written medical expert reports within 120 days of each defendant filing an answer and appearing in the matter.</description></item><item><title>Videos and photos are effective tools to demonstrate medical malpractice injuries</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/videos-and-photos-are-effective-tools-to-demonstrate-medical-malpractice-injuries/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/videos-and-photos-are-effective-tools-to-demonstrate-medical-malpractice-injuries/</guid><description>The old saying tells us that a picture is worth a thousand words.
When Can Pictures and Videos be Compelling Evidence? Whether trying a medical malpractice lawsuit or preparing a demand package to try and resolve a case through mediation or settlement, it’s useful for injured parties to compare and contrast the plaintiff pre-injury with how he or she is getting by after the negligence.

Texas medical malpractice cases have lots of deadlines. The clock starts ticking quickly after the case is filed. One of the most formidable deadlines is the &amp;ldquo;Chapter 74&amp;rdquo; expert report deadline, which is just 120 days after the defendant doctor or hospital files an answer in the lawsuit.
Four months sounds like a long time, but with all the work that&amp;rsquo;s required to secure these expert reports, it can go by in a snap.</description></item><item><title>Past medical bills are important in a Texas medical malpractice case</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/past-medical-bills-are-important-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-case/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/past-medical-bills-are-important-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-case/</guid><description>From start to finish in a Texas medical malpractice case, it&amp;rsquo;s important to the bottom line for plaintiffs (patients) and their lawyers to have comprehensive knowledge of past medical bills and how they were paid.
Here are three reasons why this is a subject that deserves careful attention.
First, tort reform doesn&amp;rsquo;t cap economic damages, including past medical bills that were paid or that are still legally owed.

There are statutes and numerous appellate cases that deal with how to interpret when the two-year clock starts ticking and potential ways to toll or pause the limitations clock. I&amp;rsquo;ve written about some of these before, including the discovery rule and continuing treatment doctrine.
Although there some situations where the plaintiff has no choice but to try and rely on one of these exceptions or loopholes to get more time to file a medical malpractice suit, I&amp;rsquo;m a big believer that the safest course of action is to file within the general two-year statute of limitations if it&amp;rsquo;s at all possible.</description></item><item><title>Are slip and fall injuries considered medical malpractice if they happen in a Texas hospital?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/are-slip-and-fall-injuries-considered-medical-malpractice-if-they-happen-in-a-texas-hospital/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/are-slip-and-fall-injuries-considered-medical-malpractice-if-they-happen-in-a-texas-hospital/</guid><description>We here at Painter Law Firm frequently get questions from other attorneys about whether a potential case falls within the dangerous grips of the Texas medical malpractice tort reform statute known as Chapter 74 (Texas Civil Practice &amp;amp; Remedies Code Ch. 74).

Thus, a competent medical malpractice attorney will consider and focus on selecting the best Texas county for the client&amp;rsquo;s case that&amp;rsquo;s allowed under Texas venue laws.</description></item><item><title>How does comparative negligence work in a Texas medical malpractice trial?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-does-comparative-negligence-work-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-trial/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-does-comparative-negligence-work-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-trial/</guid><description>Comparative negligence (or proportionate responsibility) is a legal doctrine that allows a defendant to try and shift blame onto the plaintiff. In the context of a Texas medical malpractice case, this can come up in a few ways.
Failure to disclose past medical history
In a physician-patient relationship, the physician owes a duty to the patient to provide medical care and treatment within the standard care. In the same relationship, though, the Texas Supreme Court has contemplated that a patient may owe a duty to the physician to disclose prior medical conditions or diagnoses.</description></item><item><title>Texas Supreme Court order reins in medical malpractice discovery stays</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-supreme-court-order-reins-in-medical-malpractice-discovery-stays/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-supreme-court-order-reins-in-medical-malpractice-discovery-stays/</guid><description>One of the major aims of Texas tort reform law (Texas Medical Liability Act) is to make it difficult for injured patients and their families to sue doctors and hospitals.
One of the ways that the law thwarts access to the courts is by placing a limited discovery stay on medical malpractice cases. One of the ways that defendants and their attorneys have tried to make it even tougher is by trying to expand the scope of the discovery stay.</description></item><item><title>The ins and outs of how nursing home contract arbitration clauses harm Texas patients</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-ins-and-outs-of-how-nursing-home-contract-arbitration-clauses-harm-texas-patients/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-ins-and-outs-of-how-nursing-home-contract-arbitration-clauses-harm-texas-patients/</guid><description>Study after study has concluded that Texas consistently ranks at the bottom of all states when it comes to the quality of nursing home care.
I think one of the big reasons that so many Texas nursing homes offer needlessly dangerous care to patients is poor staffing levels.

The charge is a set of questions that the jury must answer based on the evidence presented in the case.
The first question is whether any defendant&amp;rsquo;s conduct was negligent and caused injury to the plaintiff.
When there are multiple defendants in a case, next comes the proportionate responsibility question. In this question, the jury assigns a percentage responsibility to each defendant for the plaintiff&amp;rsquo;s injuries.</description></item><item><title>Overcoming the challenges of proving loss of future earning capacity when you're under-employed or temporarily unemployed</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/overcoming-the-challenges-of-proving-loss-of-future-earning-capacity-when-youre-under-employed-or-temporarily-unemployed/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/overcoming-the-challenges-of-proving-loss-of-future-earning-capacity-when-youre-under-employed-or-temporarily-unemployed/</guid><description>In Texas, one of the critical factors influencing whether a medical malpractice case is viable or not is future earnings. The reason for this is the damages caps of Texas tort reform laws, which limit the amount of money recoverable in court for someone with low or no earnings versus someone who&amp;rsquo;s employed.
How does it impact a case when you&amp;rsquo;re underemployed?

The first is live testimony in the courtroom by a witness. The second is deposition testimony.
Everyone is familiar with live testimony. That&amp;rsquo;s when a witness is present in court, goes to the witness stand, is sworn in, and gives testimony in front of the judge and jury.
In a deposition, the attorneys for all parties assemble together, usually in a law office, to ask a party or witness questions under oath.</description></item><item><title>Do I have to file for probate before filing a Texas medical malpractice wrongful death lawsuit?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/do-i-have-to-file-for-probate-before-filing-a-texas-medical-malpractice-wrongful-death-lawsuit/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/do-i-have-to-file-for-probate-before-filing-a-texas-medical-malpractice-wrongful-death-lawsuit/</guid><description>When a person dies because of medical malpractice, there are potential survival claims and wrongful death claims to consider. Both types of claims are governed by a two-year statute of limitations.
Survival claims belong to the estate of the deceased person. For survival claims, there&amp;rsquo;s the general rule that only the personal representative of the estate of the deceased person has the right to file suit. In some cases, though, there&amp;rsquo;s an exception.</description></item><item><title>Audit trails can uncover doctored, altered, or forged medical records</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/audit-trails-can-uncover-doctored-altered-or-forged-medical-records/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/audit-trails-can-uncover-doctored-altered-or-forged-medical-records/</guid><description>In medical malpractice cases, there is one thing for sure: The medical records will be front and center for the parties, medical experts, and judge and jury to see. They&amp;rsquo;re so important because medical records are usually the only contemporaneous documentation of what happened in the healthcare at issue.

In social media, as in pretty much everything else in life, context is important. Posts to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or other platforms offer a snapshot in time, but don&amp;rsquo;t necessary give a true representation of what the person is experiencing 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The truth is, most people try to put on a happy face in social media postings rather than sharing doom and gloom with the world.</description></item><item><title>Dallas court of appeals opinion highlights statute of limitations dangers for Texas medical malpractice plaintiffs</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/dallas-court-of-appeals-opinion-highlights-statute-of-limitations-dangers-for-texas-medical-malpractice-plaintiffs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/dallas-court-of-appeals-opinion-highlights-statute-of-limitations-dangers-for-texas-medical-malpractice-plaintiffs/</guid><description>The general statute of limitations in Texas for medical malpractice cases is two years. From time to time, victims of medical malpractice and even attorneys who don&amp;rsquo;t often handle these complex cases suggest that they can get an extra 75 days by sending a notice letter.
Even though Texas Civil Practice &amp;amp; Remedies Code Section 74.051 states that a 75 day tolling period is available, the way appellate courts have interpreted this make it fraught with peril and, in my opinion, nothing more than a mirage.</description></item><item><title>Is it possible to get punitive damages in a Texas medical malpractice lawsuit?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/is-it-possible-to-get-punitive-damages-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-lawsuit/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/is-it-possible-to-get-punitive-damages-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-lawsuit/</guid><description>Yes, a jury may award punitive damages, or exemplary damages as they&amp;rsquo;re called under Texas law, in a medical malpractice lawsuit. There are some tough standards in place, though, that must be met to support punitive damages.
What are punitive (exemplary) damages under Texas law?
Texas Civil Practice &amp;amp; Remedies Code Section 41.001(5) defines exemplary damages as any damages awarded as a penalty or punishment. Thus, exemplary or punitive damages aren&amp;rsquo;t considered economic or non-economic damages.</description></item><item><title>How do caps apply to what I can recover in a wrongful death medical malpractice lawsuit in Texas?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-do-caps-apply-to-what-i-can-recover-in-a-wrongful-death-medical-malpractice-lawsuit-in-texas/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-do-caps-apply-to-what-i-can-recover-in-a-wrongful-death-medical-malpractice-lawsuit-in-texas/</guid><description>Unfortunately, Texas victims of medical malpractice face the toughest, least fair caps on damages in America. With the lack of financial accountability that Texas hospitals and physicians have under so-called tort reform laws, there&amp;rsquo;s little wonder why Texas healthcare ranks near the bottom when it comes to patient safety.
In wrongful death medical malpractice cases, there are actually two separate caps that apply to every case.
The first cap, on non-economic damages, applies to every medical malpractice case in Texas courts.</description></item><item><title>Dallas court of appeals upholds plaintiff's jury verdict in medical malpractice lawsuit filed after two-year statute of limitations</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/dallas-court-of-appeals-upholds-plaintiffs-jury-verdict-in-medical-malpractice-lawsuit-filed-after-two-year-statute-of-limitations/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/dallas-court-of-appeals-upholds-plaintiffs-jury-verdict-in-medical-malpractice-lawsuit-filed-after-two-year-statute-of-limitations/</guid><description>In August 2019, the Dallas Court of Appeals recently entered an opinion that provides insights on how the Open Courts provision of the Texas Constitution might help medical malpractice plaintiffs who have missed the standard two-year statute of limitations deadline.

When you ask for the records, be sure to emphasize that you want all of them.
Many hospital records offices seem to think that patients are only interested in physician notes. Oftentimes, though, some of the most useful information may be contained elsewhere, in places like nursing notes, flow sheets, laboratory reports, and radiology reports.</description></item><item><title>New Texas law restores common sense, will benefit some medical medical malpractice victims</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/new-texas-law-restores-common-sense-will-benefit-some-medical-medical-malpractice-victims/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/new-texas-law-restores-common-sense-will-benefit-some-medical-medical-malpractice-victims/</guid><description>Sometimes the Texas legislature writes laws that are unclear.

That&amp;rsquo;s pretty remarkable, given the tort reform mania that&amp;rsquo;s plagued Texas for over 15 years.
When there&amp;rsquo;s a settlement or judgment resulting from medical malpractice, plaintiffs and their attorneys are required by law to protect certain interests of third parties.

As in all civil cases, it&amp;rsquo;s the plaintiff&amp;rsquo;s (patient&amp;rsquo;s) burden of proof.

Mediation is a meeting where the parties to a dispute get together to try to work it out with the assistance of an experienced neutral third party.</description></item><item><title>How to know if the Texas medical malpractice attorney you hire will actually be handling your case</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-to-know-if-the-texas-medical-malpractice-attorney-you-hire-will-actually-be-handling-your-case/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-to-know-if-the-texas-medical-malpractice-attorney-you-hire-will-actually-be-handling-your-case/</guid><description>One of the things that I enjoy about being a Houston, Texas medical malpractice attorney is working directly with and getting to know my clients.

A surviving spouse can be from a traditional ceremonial marriage or a common law marriage.

The major hurdle is at 120 days after each hospital, doctor, or healthcare provider files an answer in a new medical negligence lawsuit.

&amp;nbsp;
Texas Civil &amp;amp; Practice Remedies Code, Chapter 74, governs health care liability claims. Many attorneys consider health care liability claims to be synonymous with medical malpractice cases, but the statutory definition is more expansive, and navigating when and how it applies can cause some pitfalls.&amp;nbsp;
Chapter 74 almost always applies
A health care liability claim includes any cause of action against a &amp;ldquo;health care provider or physician for treatment, lack of treatment, or other claim to departure from accepted standards of medical care, or healthcare, or safety or professional or administrative services directly related to healthcare, which proximately results in injury to or death of a claimant, whether the claimant&amp;rsquo;s claim or cause of action sounds in tort or contract.</description></item><item><title>Hiring an experienced Houston medical malpractice attorney can help you satisfy the tricky Texas expert requirement</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/hiring-an-experienced-houston-medical-malpractice-attorney-can-help-you-satisfy-the-tricky-texas-expert-requirement/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/hiring-an-experienced-houston-medical-malpractice-attorney-can-help-you-satisfy-the-tricky-texas-expert-requirement/</guid><description>This morning, I received an email from a potential client who is facing an imminent statute of limitations deadline in a potential medical malpractice case.

In most types of civil cases, a plaintiff could file a lawsuit the day after the negligence occurred. Experienced medical malpractice attorneys know that, when a healthcare provider commits negligence, there is a lot of work to do before filing suit.
