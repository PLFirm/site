Early detection is a critical factor to improve outcomes and survival rates.
The cornerstone of preventive healthcare is regular breast cancer screening, primarily through mammograms. When doctors, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants donâ€™t follow established standards of care, such as notifying patients about dense breast tissue or offering supplemental screening, the consequences can be devastating.
