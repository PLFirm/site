When a clot breaks loose, travels, and blocks an artery supplying the lung, it is called a pulmonary embolism. When a pulmonary embolism is not diagnosed and treated properly, the mortality rate is around 30 percent. When promptly treated, the death rate is less than 10 percent.</description></item></channel></rss>
