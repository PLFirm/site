Both service members and dependents pull through a lot of challenges and tough times knowing that they are not alone.
Unfortunately, when medical malpractice happens in a Navy, Army, or Air Force hospital, the victims often feel isolated. In a culture where hopes of promotion are pinned on perfect performance reviews, the brass does not usually encourage open talk or investigation of what went wrong when someone is needlessly injured or dies as a result of poor health care on base or on post.</description></item></channel></rss>
