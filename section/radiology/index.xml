How is it that an otherwise healthy, middle-aged man who has suspected kidney stones dies from a CT scan?
What are CT and MRI scans?
CT and MRI are two types of diagnostic radiology scans.
Doctors and surgeons order diagnostic radiology scans so they can have images of internal structures and conditions.</description></item><item><title>Outpatient imaging centers and the increased risk of brain injury or death</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/outpatient-imaging-centers-and-the-increased-risk-of-brain-injury-or-death/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/outpatient-imaging-centers-and-the-increased-risk-of-brain-injury-or-death/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a tragic case involving the death of a middle-aged man who went for a routine CT scan for contrast at an outpatient imaging center in the Dallas area.

The case arises from the death of a two-year-old little girl.
She was born at the prestigious Johns Hopkins Hospital and then admitted to the hospital&amp;rsquo;s neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).
A nurse practitioner working in the NICU became aware of ultrasound findings of a cyst-like mass on the baby&amp;rsquo;s right adrenal gland.</description></item><item><title>What you should know about mediastinal masses</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-you-should-know-about-mediastinal-masses/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-you-should-know-about-mediastinal-masses/</guid><description>When a physician tells a patient that he or she suspects a mediastinal mass, the first question that many people ask is, &amp;ldquo;What is the mediastinum?&amp;rdquo;
Mediastinum is in the chest, specifically the area that is between the lungs. It&amp;rsquo;s actually pretty large area&amp;mdash;I vividly remember gross anatomy during my first year of medical school and how surprised I was to see the large size of the lungs. The mediastinum contains the heart, esophagus, trachea (windpipe) and the large blood vessels going to heart.</description></item><item><title>What neuroradiologists look for to identify hypoxic-ischemic brain injury</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-neuroradiologists-look-for-to-identify-hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-neuroradiologists-look-for-to-identify-hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury/</guid><description>When there&amp;rsquo;s a suspicion or confirmation that a newborn infant has a brain injury, it&amp;rsquo;s common for a neonatologist or physician to order an MRI scan of the brain.

They do not see or evaluate patients in person. Instead, their medical practice is focused on reviewing images on a computer screen, often off-site and away from the hospital.
In contrast, clinical physicians, including specialties such as&amp;nbsp;emergency medicine, hospitalist medicine, internal medicine, neurology, and surgical specialties, actually see patients in person, interview them for a medical&amp;nbsp;history, and order tests and studies to put together the complete picture of what&amp;rsquo;s causing the patient&amp;rsquo;s problems.</description></item><item><title>What can the trial court consider at a Chapter 74 preliminary expert report hearing in a Texas medical malpractice case?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-can-the-trial-court-consider-at-a-chapter-74-preliminary-expert-report-hearing-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-case/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-can-the-trial-court-consider-at-a-chapter-74-preliminary-expert-report-hearing-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-case/</guid><description>Texas law requires medical malpractice plaintiffs to produce one or more medical expert reports within 120 days of each defendant filing an answer and a lawsuit.

Day by day, there&amp;rsquo;s an erosion of healthcare decision-making out of the hands of patients, and even their doctors.

Radiologists are doctors with specialized training after medical school focused on how to interpret a variety of diagnostic radiological studies including x-rays, CT scans, MRI scans, and angiograms. Neuroradiologists have additional training focused on interpreting images of the brain and nervous system.
The most frequent allegation in medical malpractice claims against radiologists and neuroradiologists is that the interpretation was botched.</description></item><item><title>The questions you should ask before getting a CT or MRI scan at a stand-alone imaging center</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-questions-you-should-ask-before-getting-a-ct-or-mri-scan-at-a-stand-alone-imaging-center/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-questions-you-should-ask-before-getting-a-ct-or-mri-scan-at-a-stand-alone-imaging-center/</guid><description>It wasn&amp;rsquo;t long ago that if you needed to have a diagnostic radiology scan, such as an MRI or CT, then your only choice was to do it in a hospital. These days, though, there&amp;rsquo;s the option of having scans done at a freestanding imaging facility.
Here at Painter Law Firm, we&amp;rsquo;ve had numerous clients tell us that the doctor ordering a scan presents the option something like this: &amp;ldquo;We can schedule the scan at an imaging facility where it will cost you $800, or at a hospital where it may cost you $2,000.</description></item><item><title>Surgeons &amp; operating room nurses shouldn't leave surgical items inside patients after a procedure</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surgeons-operating-room-nurses-shouldnt-leave-surgical-items-inside-patients-after-a-procedure/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surgeons-operating-room-nurses-shouldnt-leave-surgical-items-inside-patients-after-a-procedure/</guid><description>It seems pretty obvious.
When the operating room (OR) team performs a surgery on a patient, the surgeons and nurses shouldn&amp;rsquo;t leave items in the patient&amp;rsquo;s body.
As a former hospital administrator, I know that hospital accrediting organizations, such as The Joint Commission, refer to these situations as &amp;ldquo;never events.&amp;rdquo; Yet, in my experience, they happen a lot more frequently than you might think. In fact, the medical community has come up with a preferred term, &amp;ldquo;retained surgical item&amp;rdquo; (RSI) to try and obscure what they&amp;rsquo;re talking about.</description></item><item><title>What you should know about the common mistakes involving radiology scans</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-you-should-know-about-the-common-mistakes-involving-radiology-scans/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-you-should-know-about-the-common-mistakes-involving-radiology-scans/</guid><description>When doctors, physician&amp;rsquo;s assistants, or nurse practitioners order a diagnostic radiology study, such as an MRI or CT scan, it&amp;rsquo;s based on a clinical indication.
The clinical indication on a radiology order is important
The clinical indication refers to the clinical situation that&amp;rsquo;s the reason for the study&amp;nbsp;and is typically the only clinical information that&amp;rsquo;s provided to the radiologist.
For example, if a patient arrived at the emergency room (ER) with symptoms that make the physician suspect stroke, the clinical indication may be &amp;ldquo;stroke.</description></item><item><title>Study uncovers the most common diagnostic errors by radiologists</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/study-uncovers-the-most-common-diagnostic-errors-by-radiologists/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/study-uncovers-the-most-common-diagnostic-errors-by-radiologists/</guid><description>Radiologists are physicians with advanced training in the interpretation of diagnostic radiology studies such as MRI and CT scans. They rarely, if ever, see a patient face to face and aren&amp;rsquo;t typically involved in making treatment decisions. In fact, they might even review radiology images from a remote location rather than in the hospital.
When a clinical physician, such as an internal medicine doctor, hospitalist, surgeon, or neurologist, orders a radiology scan, they usually provide a brief explanation of the reason for the order.</description></item><item><title>Medical malpractice wrongful death lawsuit: Routine CT scan with contrast ends in death at Gateway Diagnostic Imaging, LLC d/b/a Gateway Diagnostic Mid-Cities</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/medical-malpractice-wrongful-death-lawsuit-routine-ct-scan-with-contrast-ends-in-death-at-gateway-diagnostic-imaging-llc-d/b/a-gateway-diagnostic-mid-cities/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/medical-malpractice-wrongful-death-lawsuit-routine-ct-scan-with-contrast-ends-in-death-at-gateway-diagnostic-imaging-llc-d/b/a-gateway-diagnostic-mid-cities/</guid><description>Painter Law Firm filed a medical malpractice wrongful death lawsuit yesterday against Gateway Diagnostic Imaging, LLC d/b/a Gateway Diagnostic Mid-Cities and three physicians arising from the death of a healthy 52-year-old man following a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis for suspected kidney stones.

Plus, there&amp;rsquo;s the cost issue.

For instance, a man went to see a urologist because he was having pain between his ribs and hips (the flank area). The doctor thought it was likely a kidney stone but ordered an abdominal CT scan just to be sure.
A radiologist interpreted the CT scan and, sure enough, found the kidney stone.</description></item><item><title>Radiology malpractice: The danger of interpreting a CT or MRI without talking to anyone about the patient</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/radiology-malpractice-the-danger-of-interpreting-a-ct-or-mri-without-talking-to-anyone-about-the-patient/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/radiology-malpractice-the-danger-of-interpreting-a-ct-or-mri-without-talking-to-anyone-about-the-patient/</guid><description>I am working on a medical malpractice case now where one of the defendants is a neuroradiologist whom we believe misread a head CT scan.

As a former hospital administrator, I love to see healthcare providers taking a proactive approach, like this, that can improve patient safety.
The survey dealt with whether emergency room (ER) physicians review diagnostic imaging studies, like x-rays, CT scans, and MRIs.

While this rather informal survey was not intended to be scientifically or statistically valid, the results &amp;nbsp;were interesting to me, based on my experience in handling many cases involving radiologists and other physicians missing significant findings on radiology studies.</description></item><item><title>Doctor, nurse practitioner ignore MRI results for two years, woman dies of cancer</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/doctor-nurse-practitioner-ignore-mri-results-for-two-years-woman-dies-of-cancer/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/doctor-nurse-practitioner-ignore-mri-results-for-two-years-woman-dies-of-cancer/</guid><description>As a Houston, Texas medical malpractice lawyer, many of the lawsuits that I handle for patients and family members involve a failure of communication. &amp;nbsp;This type of medical error usually occurs when there is a hand-off from one healthcare provider to another.
Think about it. &amp;nbsp;The provision of modern health care involves a lot of different players including, doctors, specialists, nurses, laboratory techs, radiologists, and pathologists. &amp;nbsp;When one healthcare provider refers an order or consultation to another provider, poor systems allow results to get lost in the shuffle.</description></item><item><title>High school senior dies after doctors botch diagnosis and treatment of acute disseminated encephalomalacia (ADEM)</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/high-school-senior-dies-after-doctors-botch-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-acute-disseminated-encephalomalacia-adem/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/high-school-senior-dies-after-doctors-botch-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-acute-disseminated-encephalomalacia-adem/</guid><description>As a Houston, Texas medical malpractice lawyer, every day my law firm hears tragic stories from clients&amp;nbsp;about how lives were changed or ended because of poor medical care.

A deposition is basically a meeting where an attorney can ask a party or witness in the lawsuit questions under oath in front of a court reporter, with all of the other attorneys present. It is typically not done in the courthouse, but rather in an attorney&amp;rsquo;s office.</description></item><item><title>X-rays and CT scans: Radiation risk and malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/x-rays-and-ct-scans-radiation-risk-and-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/x-rays-and-ct-scans-radiation-risk-and-malpractice/</guid><description>In most of the cases that I handle, in my career as a Houston, Texas medical malpractice lawyer, patients have had some type of radiology study. It could be an x-ray, CT scan, MRI scan, or other study.
While radiology studies are often helpful when it comes to diagnosing a patient, there is an increasing debate in the medical community about the over-use and reliance on imaging. The concern is that doctors should not order radiology studies when it is possible to make a diagnosis without them.</description></item><item><title>What happens when critical lab or radiology results are not communicated to the doctor</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-happens-when-critical-lab-or-radiology-results-are-not-communicated-to-the-doctor/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-happens-when-critical-lab-or-radiology-results-are-not-communicated-to-the-doctor/</guid><description>I focus my Houston, Texas-based law practice on representing patients and family members in medical malpractice cases.

Another organization that has the unique vantage point for medical errors is the Joint Commission, which is a major accrediting organization for hospitals and healthcare facilities. Each year, the Joint Commission issues a list of several National Patient Safety Goals, based on its analysis of common medical errors and recommendations on how to reduce them.</description></item><item><title>Two dangerous risks of CT, MRI, and other diagnostic radiology exams</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/two-dangerous-risks-of-ct-mri-and-other-diagnostic-radiology-exams/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/two-dangerous-risks-of-ct-mri-and-other-diagnostic-radiology-exams/</guid><description>Diagnostic imaging is an amazing tool that has rapidly advanced in medicine over the past few decades. In addition to old-school x-rays, radiologists have tools like MRI scans, CT scans, MR angiograms, CT angiograms, and other tests that can help provide insight on what is going on inside a patient&amp;rsquo;s body.
Radiological information can be extremely valuable to doctors caring for a patient because it allows them to link clinical findings, signs, and symptoms, with findings from the scans.</description></item><item><title>'Stat' means 'now': How hospitals bungle urgent CT and MRI orders</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/stat-means-now-how-hospitals-bungle-urgent-ct-and-mri-orders/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jul 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/stat-means-now-how-hospitals-bungle-urgent-ct-and-mri-orders/</guid><description>A doctor orders radiology studies for a patient when a physical exam suggests a preliminary diagnosis but additional information is necessary to be certain. Having the correct diagnosis is essential for selecting the correct treatment.
Frequently, a doctor orders a radiology scan, like computer aided tomography (CT or &amp;ldquo;CAT scan&amp;rdquo;) or magnetic resonance image (MRI), when he or she needs detailed information about an internal part of the body.
After the CT or MRI is ordered, a nurse or hospital administrative staff gets the order to a radiology department.</description></item></channel></rss>
