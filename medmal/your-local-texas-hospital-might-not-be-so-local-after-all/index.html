We handle anesthesia error, surgical error, birth injury, brain injury, sepsis, bariatric, lap band, gastric bypass, infection, and many other types of medical negligence cases.</p><p>Clients from many cities and towns across Texas have shared with us their belief that local attorneys are scared to file a lawsuit against local hospitals. Before reaching Painter Law Firm, some of our clients were turned down by multiple local lawyers who said they did not want to tackle a hometown hospital at the courthouse.</p><p>When we start representing a new client, one of the things we do is research the hospital involved and who actually owns it. Over our many years of handling medical malpractice cases in Texas, we have found that many hospitals are owned and operated by far-away, out-of-state big corporations.</p><p>If you or someone you care for has been injured during hospital care, call 281-580-8800 for a complimentary consultation with the Houston medical malpractice attorneys at Painter Law Firm.</p><p><strong>Alphabetical list of hospital owners and where they are located</strong></p><p>If you are interested in researching a hospital, scroll through this list of all licensed Texas hospitals, which is alphabetized by the hospital names.
