Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.</p><h2>What This Privacy Policy Covers</h2><p>This policy covers how Painter Law Firm treats personal information that Painter Law Firm collects and receives, including information related to your past use of Painter Law Firm products and services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Painter Law Firm does not own or control, or to people that Painter Law Firm does not employ or manage. In addition, certain Painter Law Firm associated companies such as Google have their own privacy statements which can be viewed by visiting the sites and searching for their privacy policies.</p><h2>Information Collection and Use</h2><p>Painter Law Firm collects personal information when you register with Painter Law Firm, when you use Painter Law Firm products or services, when you visit Painter Law Firm pages or the pages of certain CURE's partners, and when you enter promotions, surveys, or sweepstakes. Painter Law Firm may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies. When you register we ask for information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, zip code, occupation, industry, and personal interests. Once you register with Painter Law Firm and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. Painter Law Firm collects information about your transactions with us and with some of our business partners, including information about your use of the services that we offer. Painter Law Firm automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, Painter Law Firm cookie information, and the page you request.</p><p>Painter Law Firm uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.</p><h2>Children</h2><p>No one under the legal age of an adult may use Painter Law Firm's services.</p><h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2><p>Painter Law Firm does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances: We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Painter Law Firm under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help Painter Law Firm communicate with you about offers from Painter Law Firm and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.</p><p>We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Painter Law Firm's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. We transfer information about you if Painter Law Firm is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Painter Law Firm will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p><p>Painter Law Firm may display targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click on targeted ads meet the targeting criteria - for example, men ages 35-50 from a particular geographic area. Painter Law Firm does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad. Painter Law Firm advertisers include financial service providers (such as banks, insurance agents, stock brokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial companies (such as stores, airlines, and software companies). Painter Law Firm works with vendors, partners, advertisers, and other service providers in different industries and categories of business.</p><h2>Cookies</h2><p>Painter Law Firm may set and access cookies on your computer. Painter Law Firm lets other companies that show advertisements on some of our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to Painter Law Firm's cookies. Painter Law Firm uses cookies only inside our network of web sites and in connection with Painter Law Firm products and services.</p><h2>Confidentiality and Security</h2><p>We limit access to personal information about you to Painter Law Firm agents who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect personal information about you.</p><h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2><p>Painter Law Firm may update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your Painter Law Firm account or by placing a prominent notice on our site.</p><h2>Questions and Suggestions</h2><p>If you have questions or suggestions, please complete a feedback form.</p><p><a href=https://painterfirm.com/contact>Contact us with your questions.</p></div></article></div></main><div class="subscribe animate"><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col col-12"><div class=subscribe__inner><div class=subscribe__content><h3 class=subscribe__title><a href=tel:+1-281-580-8800><i class="ion ion-ios-call"></i> Call 281-580-8800</a></h3><p class=subscribe__description>Free consultation.
