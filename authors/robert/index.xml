Polycythemia, a blood disorder where there’s an excess of red blood cells, requires careful management.

However, a potentially dangerous condition called excessive uterine activity can sometimes fly under the radar, leading to devastating consequences.

About a week earlier, Michael saw his cardiologist because he had new chest pain and shortness of breath when he took short walks.

While cord blood gas results can provide insight into a baby&amp;rsquo;s condition, defense experts in birth injury lawsuits often wrongly argue that normal values completely rule out hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), brain injuries, and other neurologic injuries.
If your child has suffered brain damage and you&amp;rsquo;re being told their cord blood gases were normal, do not accept this at face value - there is much more to the story.</description></item><item><title>Pharmacy Malpractice in Texas: All You Need to Know</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/pharmacy-malpractice-texas/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/pharmacy-malpractice-texas/</guid><description>When you fill a prescription at your local, grocery, or chain pharmacy, you trust that the highly trained pharmacist will dispense the correct medication at the proper dosage.

In the hustle and bustle of labor and delivery, a lot of things happen. One of the first assessments performed on a newborn is the Apgar score, a quick evaluation that’s been around since the 1950s to look at the baby&amp;rsquo;s overall health.

In fact, for those inexperienced with a specialized area of law, it’s fraught with perils. I’ve often described it as the Texas medical malpractice minefield.
From a practical perspective, investigating a potential medical malpractice claim and preparing it for filing in court revolves around acquiring all the relevant medical records and obtaining opinions from physicians, nursing, and other experts.

Common types of obstetric anesthesia
For vaginal or natural deliveries, obstetric anesthesiologists and CRNAs often use an&amp;nbsp;epidural&amp;nbsp;for pain control. Epidural anesthesia is delivered by a catheter that&amp;rsquo;s inserted into the epidural space of the mother&amp;rsquo;s spine usually near the T10&amp;ndash;L1 level.

In the past, patients had the sole option of going to a hospital operating room. Ambulatory or outpatient surgery centers were opened as an alternative to hospitals for low-risk patients having low-risk surgeries. More recently, though, ambulatory surgery centers have accepted higher-risk patients who were having more complex procedures.
From what we&amp;rsquo;ve learned from clients, some Texas surgeons and ambulatory surgery centers don&amp;rsquo;t spend much, if any time, discussing the added risks of having surgery outside a hospital setting.</description></item><item><title>New study highlights the risks of hospital care</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/new-study-highlights-the-risks-of-hospital-care/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/new-study-highlights-the-risks-of-hospital-care/</guid><description>One of the scariest things about healthcare is that healthcare itself isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly safe.
For decades, studies have shown that hospital, medical, and nursing mistakes are major factors in patient outcomes.

While news of a poor result or complication isn&amp;rsquo;t welcomed by anyone, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean that a hospital, physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or registered nurse did anything wrong. On the other hand, just because the informed consent paperwork lists things that could potentially go wrong with a treatment or surgery doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that a bad outcome isn&amp;rsquo;t medical malpractice.</description></item><item><title>How the discovery rule works for Texas medical malpractice cases</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-the-discovery-rule-works-for-texas-medical-malpractice-cases/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-the-discovery-rule-works-for-texas-medical-malpractice-cases/</guid><description>One of the most common questions that we receive from potential clients is whether the discovery rule applies to their case. This is invariably an interesting and complex question.
Before getting into what the discovery rule is and how it applies under Texas law to medical malpractice cases, we should first address why it&amp;rsquo;s even a thing. In three words: statute of limitations.
Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations is a law that defines how much time a party has to file a lawsuit.</description></item><item><title>3 reasons you may not want to wait and see what happens after a surgical complication</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/3-reasons-you-may-not-want-to-wait-and-see-what-happens-after-a-surgical-complication/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/3-reasons-you-may-not-want-to-wait-and-see-what-happens-after-a-surgical-complication/</guid><description>When a patient experiences a surgical complication, it&amp;rsquo;s common for the surgeon to advise allowing some time for the body to heal and return to normal.

This fact sometimes gets glossed over, though, in patient-surgeon discussions. This is true for emergency surgeries, but also elective surgeries, including plastic or cosmetic surgery and eye procedures.
Patients are typically focused on the benefits of having the surgery. For most surgeons&amp;mdash;who do this type of work every day&amp;mdash;performing surgeries and procedures are routine and complications are rare.

This article will briefly tackle some of the alphabet soup of physicians and providers currently providing clinical care.</description></item><item><title>The most common avoidable errors in claims against certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs)</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-most-common-avoidable-errors-in-claims-against-certified-registered-nurse-anesthetists-crnas/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-most-common-avoidable-errors-in-claims-against-certified-registered-nurse-anesthetists-crnas/</guid><description>I recently came across an interesting article in the American Association of Nurse Anesthesiology (AANA) Journal that explored at preventable acts of medical malpractice involving certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs).
What are nurse anesthetists?
Some people may be unfamiliar with the field of nurse anesthesiology or certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs). CRNAs are registered nurses with additional graduate-level training in the nursing administration and management of anesthesia, including general anesthesia during surgery.</description></item><item><title>Texas ER botches diagnosis of man's posterior circulation stroke</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-er-botches-diagnosis-of-mans-posterior-circulation-stroke/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-er-botches-diagnosis-of-mans-posterior-circulation-stroke/</guid><description>A man in his 40s suddenly felt very dizzy and became nauseated and vomited.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Ativan to treat anxiety, sleep disturbances, and seizures. It&amp;rsquo;s also sometimes administered shortly before anesthesia.
Ativan overdoses
This common drug has been in the news from time to time over claims that it&amp;rsquo;s been involved in causing patients to commit self-harm or suicide.

Anyone who has a head injury from falling, a motor vehicle accident, or other traumatic cause can develop this lethal condition.
Research shows that patients are diagnosed with traumatic subdural hematomas in around 10&amp;ndash;20% of all traumatic brain injury cases. The high risk is shown by the fact that subdural hematomas are present in up to 30% of all injuries that cause death.</description></item><item><title>Hospitalized patients are particularly at risk during this time period</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/hospitalized-patients-are-particularly-at-risk-during-this-time-period/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/hospitalized-patients-are-particularly-at-risk-during-this-time-period/</guid><description>The Joint Commission, a healthcare accrediting agency, describes hand-off communications as the transfer and acceptance of patient care between physicians, providers, or nurses.
Hand-off communications happen thousands of times every day. There should be a handoff communication every time a nurse changes shifts or a new attending or resident physician rotates onto a service.
As a former hospital administrator, I recall this topic coming up frequently. Registered nurses can be diligent about tending to a patient during the whole shift, only to drop the ball when care is transferred to a new nurse.</description></item><item><title>4 questions you can ask to help avoid anesthesia malpractice in dental offices</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/4-questions-you-can-ask-to-help-avoid-anesthesia-malpractice-in-dental-offices/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/4-questions-you-can-ask-to-help-avoid-anesthesia-malpractice-in-dental-offices/</guid><description>Pediatric dental anesthesia is in the news again after a Houston district court jury awarded a verdict of nearly $100 million to the family of a brain-injured little girl named Nevaeh Hall.

The time is now
Before addressing this common question, I want to emphasize an important point. The best time to investigate a potential medical malpractice claim is always now. Here are some reasons why:

Since 2016, the accepted term recommended by the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel is &amp;ldquo;pressure injury.&amp;rdquo;

And that perspective guides recommendations for a patient&amp;rsquo;s plan of care.
This is one reason why considering a second opinion on elective or non-emergency medical or surgical care is often a good idea.
Another reason we see from time to time is that some physicians, surgeons, and providers seem eager to proceed with the costliest, often invasive, treatment before trying other more conservative approaches.</description></item><item><title>When nurses override medication warnings, it places patients at a higher risk</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/when-nurses-override-medication-warnings-it-places-patients-at-a-higher-risk/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/when-nurses-override-medication-warnings-it-places-patients-at-a-higher-risk/</guid><description>Giving medication in a hospital setting isn&amp;rsquo;t always as straight-forward as it seems.

Her comment got me thinking about how old school medical care is different than what’s touted as improved care today.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services defines an adverse event as an event in which care resulted in an undesirable clinical outcome&amp;mdash;an outcome not caused by underlying disease&amp;mdash; that prolonged the patient stay, caused permanent patient harm, required life-saving intervention, or contributed to death.</description></item><item><title>Can chiropractic adjustment cause a brachial plexus nerve injury?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/can-chiropractic-adjustment-cause-a-brachial-plexus-nerve-injury/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/can-chiropractic-adjustment-cause-a-brachial-plexus-nerve-injury/</guid><description>A man in his 30s&amp;ndash;we&amp;rsquo;ll call him Brandon&amp;ndash; went to a chiropractor for relief from tight, sore shoulders, hands, and arms.
What is a chiropractor?
Although chiropractors are not physicians, they&amp;rsquo;re referred to as &amp;ldquo;doctors&amp;rdquo; because they hold doctoral degrees from a chiropractic school.
Chiropractors are healthcare professionals who are best known for managing back and neck pain through manipulations of the spine and neck.

Most expecting moms establish a relationship with an obstetrician who becomes familiar with the patientâ€™s condition and medical history over the course of regular prenatal care.</description></item><item><title>Federal law bans hospital emergency rooms from dumping patients in active labor or with emergency medical conditions</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/federal-law-bans-hospital-emergency-rooms-from-dumping-patients-in-active-labor-or-with-emergency-medical-conditions/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/federal-law-bans-hospital-emergency-rooms-from-dumping-patients-in-active-labor-or-with-emergency-medical-conditions/</guid><description>After recently watching Tom Cruiseâ€™s Top Gun: Maverick, I canâ€™t help but nostalgically thinking about the 1980s of my childhood. In my book, one of the great things about the 80s was President Ronald Reagan.&amp;nbsp;
One of President Reaganâ€™s enduring legislative accomplishments, which is still relevant to medical malpractice, is the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA), which he signed into law in 1986.

Academically, experts, professors, and students approach the science of decision-making from diverse disciplines including behavioral economics and social psychology.
Some research suggests that 60% of medical errors and malpractice claims involving hospital emergency rooms arise from failures. I think many of these errors are related to physician decision-making that bypasses the tested and true differential diagnosis process.</description></item><item><title>Neurosurgeons face class action lawsuit alleging unnecessary spine surgeries</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/neurosurgeons-face-class-action-lawsuit-alleging-unnecessary-spine-surgeries/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/neurosurgeons-face-class-action-lawsuit-alleging-unnecessary-spine-surgeries/</guid><description>â€œIf your only toolâ€™s a hammer, then everything looks like a nail.â€

Before their emergence in the market, patients only had one option for operating room and surgical services, a hospital.
Now, outpatient or ambulatory surgical centers are seemingly everywhere. From a financial perspective, these non-hospital operating room setups are touted for their cost savings.
For sure, they benefit insurance companies because they are less expensive than the hospitals. In fact, if you have health insurance and schedule surgery, your insurance company may call to encourage you to select a freestanding surgery facility rather than the hospital, to save money.</description></item><item><title>Houston appellate court: Ophthalmologist qualified to diagnose ganglioglioma tumor</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/houston-appellate-court-ophthalmologist-qualified-to-diagnose-ganglioglioma-tumor/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/houston-appellate-court-ophthalmologist-qualified-to-diagnose-ganglioglioma-tumor/</guid><description>There&amp;rsquo;s probably not a more dreaded word to hear a doctor say than &amp;ldquo;cancer.&amp;rdquo; When it is uttered about a child, though, it&amp;rsquo;s even more heart wrenching.

Of course, many physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, nurses and other personnel have worked in the front line in treating people battling the coronavirus. But the pandemic has also highlighted some hospital system problems that have long been in place.
A great example of this is nurse staffing ratios.

Even with all the changes in modern health care, physicians and surgeons in most medical specialties are typically rather old school.

Unlike the statute in a whole, I believe that this amendment will be helpful to medical malpractice plaintiffs.
A primer on Texas tort reform
Before getting into this year&amp;rsquo;s amendment, let&amp;rsquo;s briefly revisit how medical malpractice tort reform works in Texas. Broadly speaking, there are two functions. First, there is a gatekeeper role to prevent or discourage certain types of cases from making it to the jury.</description></item><item><title>Surgeons should take seriously patient complaints of pain after surgery</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surgeons-should-take-seriously-patient-complaints-of-pain-after-surgery/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surgeons-should-take-seriously-patient-complaints-of-pain-after-surgery/</guid><description>Laparoscopic, or minimally invasive, surgeries are popular and common because they cause less scarring and usually require less downtime.
The most common problem that we hear about from potential clients calling Painter Law Firm is the unintended injury of the nearby organ during surgery. The most common of these iatrogenic (healthcare-acquired) injuries are lacerated or torn bowel, stomach, liver, or spleen. These injuries are more difficult to spot during surgery because the surgeon is working with equipment and a camera inserted through small incisions in the abdomen.</description></item><item><title>Why almost dying or almost having a serious injury isn't enough for a medical malpractice claim</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/why-almost-dying-or-almost-having-a-serious-injury-isnt-enough-for-a-medical-malpractice-claim/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/why-almost-dying-or-almost-having-a-serious-injury-isnt-enough-for-a-medical-malpractice-claim/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s a scary thing to almost die.
Here at Painter Law Firm, we speak with multiple people each week who&amp;rsquo;ve had this experience, either with themselves or a family member.
Under Texas law, though, almost dying or almost having a serious injury isn&amp;rsquo;t enough to justify a medical malpractice case.
Medical malpractice is a form of negligence.
Most people focus on the first element of negligence claims&amp;mdash;the mistake. More precisely, negligence causes of action require a plaintiff to show that a person violated a duty owed to another person.</description></item><item><title>What medical care should look like after syncope (passing out)</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-medical-care-should-look-like-after-syncope-passing-out/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-medical-care-should-look-like-after-syncope-passing-out/</guid><description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen someone lose consciousness, it&amp;rsquo;s frightening and disturbing&amp;mdash;even after the person wakes up. The medical term for this phenomenon is syncope.
Physicians and healthcare providers define syncope as a sudden transient loss of consciousness with a spontaneous recovery. According to recent data from the Annals of Emergency Medicine, episodes of adult syncope account for 1.2&amp;ndash;1.8 million emergency room visits annually in the United States.

When they encounter complex medical issues of the eye, they should refer patients to an ophthalmologist.

Platelets are blood cells devoted to forming clots. They&amp;rsquo;re dispatched to stop bleeding at a site of an injury and are crucial parts of keeping our blood system stable, called hemostasis.
Thrombocytopenia is normally diagnosed through laboratory testing called a complete blood count (CBC). When a CBC test reveals that the patient has thrombocytopenia, a surprising number of physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners take a &amp;ldquo;wait and see&amp;rdquo; approach rather than investigating the potential causes for the low platelet count.</description></item><item><title>How labor and delivery nurses decide which moms need priority evaluation and care</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-labor-and-delivery-nurses-decide-which-moms-need-priority-evaluation-and-care/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-labor-and-delivery-nurses-decide-which-moms-need-priority-evaluation-and-care/</guid><description>One of the challenges facing nurses in a hospital labor and delivery department is being able to identify those patients who need the most urgent evaluation and care.

As a former hospital administrator, I know that sentinel events (also called never events) are a big deal. Accrediting agencies require hospital leaders to investigate sentinel events using a process called a root cause analysis. The idea is that this deep dive will identify what led to the serious health care error and what changes to policies, procedures, and education can prevent it from injuring other patients in the future.</description></item><item><title>Wrong site, wrong person surgeries among top serious 2020 medical errors</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/wrong-site-wrong-person-surgeries-among-top-serious-2020-medical-errors/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/wrong-site-wrong-person-surgeries-among-top-serious-2020-medical-errors/</guid><description>Healthcare accrediting agency The Joint Commission recently announced the statistics for sentinel events that were reported in 2020.
Sentinel events are also known as never events because they&amp;rsquo;re considered basic patient safety lapses that should never occur. As a former hospital administrator, I am very familiar with the root cause analysis process that accreditation standards require hospitals to follow when a sentinel event occurs.

The 2003 round of tort reform places every medical malpractice case filed in a Texas state court at risk of dismissal if a plaintiff doesn&amp;rsquo;t serve a sufficient medical expert report on a defendant within 120 days of that defendant filing an answer in the lawsuit.
Appellate courts contend that a sufficient expert report only has to be detailed enough to provide the defendant with fair notice of the allegations in the lawsuit and to demonstrate to the court that the case has merit.</description></item><item><title>The educational role of home health and wound care nurses</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-educational-role-of-home-health-and-wound-care-nurses/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-educational-role-of-home-health-and-wound-care-nurses/</guid><description>Most everyone realizes that healthcare is now multidisciplinary.

Expert report dismissal
The most commonly used dispositive tool is likely the motion to dismiss early in the litigation process for an alleged failure of a plaintiff to comply with the preliminary expert report requirements. This tort reform statute is codified at Texas Civil Practice &amp;amp; Remedies Code Section 74.</description></item><item><title>Texas medical malpractice plaintiffs are free to amend preliminary expert reports</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-medical-malpractice-plaintiffs-are-free-to-amend-preliminary-expert-reports/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-medical-malpractice-plaintiffs-are-free-to-amend-preliminary-expert-reports/</guid><description>Texas law requires medical malpractice plaintiffs to produce one or more medical expert reports early in litigation.

And, of course, accreditation is necessary for facilities to receive Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance payments.</description></item><item><title>Study: An Apgar score of less than 10 comes with a greater risk of brain injury or death</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/study-an-apgar-score-of-less-than-10-comes-with-a-greater-risk-of-brain-injury-or-death/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/study-an-apgar-score-of-less-than-10-comes-with-a-greater-risk-of-brain-injury-or-death/</guid><description>Apgar scores are a part of virtually every newborn&amp;rsquo;s labor and delivery care and medical record.

Although many hospitals and practice groups have registered nurses handle informed consent paperwork, Texas law considers it a non-delegable duty of the doctor or mid-level provider.

Triage nurses perform a quick assessment of patients to determine who needs seen most urgently. ER physicians, physician assistants (PAs), and nurse practitioners (NPs) evaluate patients and order testing to determine which patients need admitted to the hospital and those who should be discharged home.
One of the important determining factors concerning discharges is whether a patient is medically stable.

Ischemic strokes can be treated with the intravenous (IV) clot-busting drug called tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) within a window of 3 to 4.</description></item><item><title>What you should know when a Texas doctor or hospital talks about brain death</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-you-should-know-when-a-texas-doctor-or-hospital-talks-about-brain-death/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-you-should-know-when-a-texas-doctor-or-hospital-talks-about-brain-death/</guid><description>Given the current state of Texas law, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but be suspicious when doctors and hospital staff member start talking about brain death.

If the bleeding is in the esophagus, stomach, or first segment of the small intestine, it&amp;rsquo;s called an upper GI bleed. If it&amp;rsquo;s below that level, including the rest of the small intestine, large intestine, rectum, or anus, it&amp;rsquo;s a lower GI bleed.
When a person has a larger massive GI bleed, it&amp;rsquo;s a dangerous situation that requires immediate medical attention.</description></item><item><title>Three common types of cancer surgery medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/three-common-types-of-cancer-surgery-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/three-common-types-of-cancer-surgery-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>The first line of treatment for many forms of cancer is surgical resection. This involves a surgeon physically removing the visible tumor plus sufficient margins of healthy-appearing tissue around the tumor to remove cancer cells that aren&amp;rsquo;t visible to the naked eye.
This requires a careful balance. Surgeons and their patients don&amp;rsquo;t want to remove too much tissue&amp;mdash;sometimes causing unsightly scars&amp;mdash;but want to remove enough tissue to get all the cancer.</description></item><item><title>Texas spine surgeon ignores textbook signs of cauda equina syndrome</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-spine-surgeon-ignores-textbook-signs-of-cauda-equina-syndrome/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-spine-surgeon-ignores-textbook-signs-of-cauda-equina-syndrome/</guid><description>Cauda equina syndrome is a dangerous medical condition that can occur after lumbar spine surgery.

If nurses, the spine surgeon, and other physicians aren&amp;rsquo;t on the lookout for the classic signs and symptoms, it can cause a delay in surgery and permanent motor and sensory disabilities for the patient.

In contrast, clinical physicians, including specialties such as&amp;nbsp;emergency medicine, hospitalist medicine, internal medicine, neurology, and surgical specialties, actually see patients in person, interview them for a medical&amp;nbsp;history, and order tests and studies to put together the complete picture of what&amp;rsquo;s causing the patient&amp;rsquo;s problems.</description></item><item><title>Hospitalists, going through the motions, and medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/hospitalists-going-through-the-motions-and-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/hospitalists-going-through-the-motions-and-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>I spent most of the day today taking the depositions of two defendant hospitalists who were involved in the botched medical care provided to my client.

All three are related to the Texas Tort Claims Act.
&amp;bull; Many people miss the notice requirement. While the general statute of limitations for medical malpractice claims is two years, plaintiffs must provide public hospitals with a notice of claim letter within six months (for state hospitals) or even less (for county or city hospitals), or the claim may be barred.</description></item><item><title>The legal documents every Texan adult should have in place today</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-legal-documents-every-texan-adult-should-have-in-place-today/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-legal-documents-every-texan-adult-should-have-in-place-today/</guid><description>A married woman in her 60s with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) went to an outpatient dialysis center in downtown Houston for hemodialysis treatments. She and her husband were happily married but maintained separate bank accounts.
One day, while sitting in the dialysis chair and receiving treatment, this woman became nonresponsive. She wasn&amp;rsquo;t breathing.

An experienced Texas medical malpractice lawyer begins the research and investigation into potential liens and subrogation interests long before mediation or settlement. It takes time to obtain the amounts that have been paid for medical bills, verify whether liens or subrogations are enforceable, and set up communications to negotiate a reduction upon settlement.</description></item><item><title>Aqueductal stenosis, obstructive hydrocephalus, and the risks of delaying surgery</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/aqueductal-stenosis-obstructive-hydrocephalus-and-the-risks-of-delaying-surgery/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/aqueductal-stenosis-obstructive-hydrocephalus-and-the-risks-of-delaying-surgery/</guid><description>Given the limited space in the head, anything that takes up too much room in your brain can cause life-threatening problems.
Hydrocephalus is one of those medical conditions, with a name that literally means &amp;ldquo;water on the head.&amp;rdquo; More accurately, hydrocephalus is caused by a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain.

Certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) are nurses, rather than physicians, with additional training to perform similar tasks.
Anesthetic medications have a powerful impact on the whole body. In the operating room, anesthesia providers play the critical role of monitoring and protecting life functions and vital organs, including the brain, heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, endocrine system, skin integrity, and nervous system, from the stress of anesthesia and surgery.</description></item><item><title>Radiology follow through and medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/radiology-follow-through-and-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/radiology-follow-through-and-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>Where I grew up, basketball is a big deal.

It&amp;rsquo;s a medical condition where a pregnant woman who previously had normal blood pressure develops high blood pressure during pregnancy, usually at the 20th week or later.
Symptoms of preeclampsia
The classic three symptoms for preeclampsia include:

While the national goal has been around 11 maternal deaths per 100,000 babies born, the most recent data reflect figures of 17.3 mothers dying per 100,000 live births.

One area of healthcare where there&amp;rsquo;s a continuous cluster of sentinel events is in the operating room (OR).

When patients come in the ER front door, they&amp;rsquo;re first seen by a triage nurse, who has a critical role in prioritizing care.
Triage is a medical term that means assigning degrees of urgency to patients based on their conditions.

Thrombi, or clots, tend to form when a patient is lying down or immobile. In other words, surgery and the following days of recovery from surgery create an ideal environment for blood clot production.
Thromboembolism is when a blood clot forms, breaks loose, and travels to another site where it blocks blood flow through a blood vessel.</description></item><item><title>Some thoughts for plaintiffs getting ready for deposition in a Texas medical malpractice case</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/some-thoughts-for-plaintiffs-getting-ready-for-deposition-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-case/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/some-thoughts-for-plaintiffs-getting-ready-for-deposition-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-case/</guid><description>Depositions are a critical part of virtually every Texas medical malpractice case.

The RN assessment and reassessment process in a PICU is important. The assessment establishes a baseline of the patient&amp;rsquo;s clinical status.</description></item><item><title>Medication error temporarily paralyzes Houston patient, causes brain injury</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/medication-error-temporarily-paralyzes-houston-patient-causes-brain-injury/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/medication-error-temporarily-paralyzes-houston-patient-causes-brain-injury/</guid><description>Medication errors come in all shapes and sizes.

Physicians generally aren&amp;rsquo;t hospital employees
There is an old, bizarre principle in Texas law called the corporate practice of medicine act. It specifies that only doctors, not corporations or other entities, can practice medicine. Therefore, hospitals cannot employ physicians.

Four months sounds like a long time, but with all the work that&amp;rsquo;s required to secure these expert reports, it can go by in a snap.</description></item><item><title>What can I do to prove medical malpractice when my medical records are false?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-can-i-do-to-prove-medical-malpractice-when-my-medical-records-are-false/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-can-i-do-to-prove-medical-malpractice-when-my-medical-records-are-false/</guid><description>One of the most frustrating things for patients and family members who&amp;rsquo;ve been harmed by medical malpractice is to read medical records that have big gaps or blatantly false information. We often get the question of, &amp;ldquo;What can we do to prove our case?&amp;rdquo;
To start, in any Texas medical malpractice case, the law requires the plaintiff to have the support of one or more medical experts. Medical experts have to define in writing the applicable standard care, how the doctor, nurse, or hospital violated the standard care, and how that conduct caused harm.</description></item><item><title>Can I record a conversation in Texas with a doctor or someone from hospital administration?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/can-i-record-a-conversation-in-texas-with-a-doctor-or-someone-from-hospital-administration/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/can-i-record-a-conversation-in-texas-with-a-doctor-or-someone-from-hospital-administration/</guid><description>This is a question that comes up pretty frequently. The follow-up to the question is whether you can record the conversation without telling the physician, nurse, or hospital administrator.
Some people like to record complicated, hard-to-comprehend medical conversations so they can listen to them later and get help to understand them. Other people record conversations as potential evidence when there was poor care or a bad healthcare outcome.
Before getting into how Texas treats the subject, it&amp;rsquo;s important to realize that the laws on this sometimes-controversial subject vary from state to state</description></item><item><title>Coronavirus sheds light on chronic nursing home problems</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/coronavirus-sheds-light-on-chronic-nursing-home-problems/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/coronavirus-sheds-light-on-chronic-nursing-home-problems/</guid><description>These days, every headline seems to have something to do with coronavirus.

It&amp;rsquo;s shedding some light on a deep dark secret that most people don&amp;rsquo;t learn until it&amp;rsquo;s too late.
Many (some would say most) nursing homes are dreadful places with inadequate staffing and overall poor care.

Trauma can include things like a car wreck, sports injury, or any blow to the head.
The neck, of course, carries the spinal cord and nerves from the brain down the back. When anything compromises the spinal cord and the neck area, it can cause problems from the neck down.</description></item><item><title>Past medical bills are important in a Texas medical malpractice case</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/past-medical-bills-are-important-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-case/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/past-medical-bills-are-important-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-case/</guid><description>From start to finish in a Texas medical malpractice case, it&amp;rsquo;s important to the bottom line for plaintiffs (patients) and their lawyers to have comprehensive knowledge of past medical bills and how they were paid.
Here are three reasons why this is a subject that deserves careful attention.
First, tort reform doesn&amp;rsquo;t cap economic damages, including past medical bills that were paid or that are still legally owed. In some serious medical malpractice cases, this can amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars.</description></item><item><title>Why time is important for a Texas medical malpractice case</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/why-time-is-important-for-a-texas-medical-malpractice-case/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/why-time-is-important-for-a-texas-medical-malpractice-case/</guid><description>We receive a lot of calls at Painter Law Firm from patients and families who are hurting or grieving over a serious injury or death caused by medical malpractice. It&amp;rsquo;s not unusual for people to call shortly before the two-year statute of limitations that applies to most cases.

Electronic fetal monitoring equipment displays and prints two separate lines. The top line measures the fetal heart rate and the bottom line measures the mom’s uterine contractions. Well-trained labor and delivery registered nurses and OB/GYN (obstetrician) physicians can obtain a wealth of information by interpreting fetal monitoring strips.</description></item><item><title>Closed-loop communication prevents critical lab, radiology results from going unnoticed</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/closed-loop-communication-prevents-critical-lab-radiology-results-from-going-unnoticed/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/closed-loop-communication-prevents-critical-lab-radiology-results-from-going-unnoticed/</guid><description>Before going to law school, I was a hospital administrator.

The Joint Commission is the nation&amp;rsquo;s oldest hospital-accrediting organization. I can tell you that hospital leaders take their standards seriously, because failure to maintain accreditation puts funding from Medicare, Medicaid, and even third-party health insurance companies at risk.

The situation started when this man went to a hospital emergency room after a week of flu-like symptoms including the typical fatigue, nausea, and vomiting, but also with problems keeping his balance and walking.

When a baby is born with a brain injury or other serious medical condition, though, a neonatologist takes over.
Neonatologists are doctors who have completed three years of pediatric residency training after medical school, and another three years of fellowship training in the intensive care of newborns. Neonatology is a hospital-based medical practice focusing on caring for babies with complex medical conditions from birth through the age of 28 days.</description></item><item><title>Doctor's failure to communicate caused emergency surgery for ectopic pregnancy</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/doctors-failure-to-communicate-caused-emergency-surgery-for-ectopic-pregnancy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/doctors-failure-to-communicate-caused-emergency-surgery-for-ectopic-pregnancy/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;What we&amp;rsquo;ve got here is failure to communicate.&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s a famous line from the Paul Newman movie Cool Hand Luke.

Radiologists are doctors with specialized training after medical school focused on how to interpret a variety of diagnostic radiological studies including x-rays, CT scans, MRI scans, and angiograms. Neuroradiologists have additional training focused on interpreting images of the brain and nervous system.
The most frequent allegation in medical malpractice claims against radiologists and neuroradiologists is that the interpretation was botched.</description></item><item><title>Two dreaded things that can happen during laparoscopic surgery</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/two-dreaded-things-that-can-happen-during-laparoscopic-surgery/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/two-dreaded-things-that-can-happen-during-laparoscopic-surgery/</guid><description>One of the risks of surgery is that an unintended structure will get injured, punctured, or lacerated.

Their lobbying efforts paid off. In 2003, as part of sweeping medical malpractice tort reform, special standards went into effect that apply to many claims involving hospital emergency room care.
In most Texas medical malpractice cases, the plaintiff has to prove general negligence. General negligence means that a physician, nurse, or other healthcare provider violated the standard of care, which is what a reasonably prudent provider would have done under the same or similar circumstances.</description></item><item><title>What you should know about spinal epidural abscess and medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-you-should-know-about-spinal-epidural-abscess-and-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-you-should-know-about-spinal-epidural-abscess-and-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>A spinal epidural abscess is a dangerous medical condition that can compress the spinal cord and cause permanent injury.

What does it mean to be intubated?
Intubation, or being intubated, occurs when a doctor or other provider inserts a flexible tube down a patient&amp;rsquo;s throat to secure an open, or patent and protected, airway.
Anesthesiologists, critical care physicians, pulmonologists, and emergency (ER) doctors are all physicians who frequently are called on to intubate patients.</description></item><item><title>HCA Houston Healthcare Tomball gets lowest-possible one-star rating from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/hca-houston-healthcare-tomball-gets-lowest-possible-one-star-rating-from-centers-for-medicare-and-medicaid-services/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/hca-houston-healthcare-tomball-gets-lowest-possible-one-star-rating-from-centers-for-medicare-and-medicaid-services/</guid><description>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently announced its annual star ranking for over 4,500 Medicare-accredited hospitals nationwide.

The standard of care requires that patients shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be discharged from the hospital if they&amp;rsquo;re unstable or there will likely be material deterioration in health status after discharge.

There are statutes and numerous appellate cases that deal with how to interpret when the two-year clock starts ticking and potential ways to toll or pause the limitations clock. I&amp;rsquo;ve written about some of these before, including the discovery rule and continuing treatment doctrine.
Although there some situations where the plaintiff has no choice but to try and rely on one of these exceptions or loopholes to get more time to file a medical malpractice suit, I&amp;rsquo;m a big believer that the safest course of action is to file within the general two-year statute of limitations if it&amp;rsquo;s at all possible.</description></item><item><title>Are slip and fall injuries considered medical malpractice if they happen in a Texas hospital?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/are-slip-and-fall-injuries-considered-medical-malpractice-if-they-happen-in-a-texas-hospital/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/are-slip-and-fall-injuries-considered-medical-malpractice-if-they-happen-in-a-texas-hospital/</guid><description>We here at Painter Law Firm frequently get questions from other attorneys about whether a potential case falls within the dangerous grips of the Texas medical malpractice tort reform statute known as Chapter 74 (Texas Civil Practice &amp;amp; Remedies Code Ch. 74).

CSF is the clear, colorless liquid that surrounds the spinal cord and brain. Adults have about two-thirds of a cup of cerebrospinal fluid, which plays several important roles.

Once finishing that residency, they continue on to a two- or three-year nephrology fellowship, where they focus on diagnosing and treating kidney diseases.
As laypeople, there are some signs and symptoms of kidney problems that we should be aware of.</description></item><item><title>Vital signs: Measurement, baseline and medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/vital-signs-measurement-baseline-and-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/vital-signs-measurement-baseline-and-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>Vital signs are some basic clinical measurements that doctors and nurses use to assess how patients&amp;rsquo; basic body systems are working. When measured over time, they also provide a useful baseline that allows healthcare providers to recognize a change in the patient&amp;rsquo;s clinical status.
Chances are, any time you&amp;rsquo;ve been in a doctor&amp;rsquo;s office or the hospital, you had at least the four basic vital signs assessed and recorded in your medical record.</description></item><item><title>Coumadin (warfarin) prescription, management, and medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/coumadin-warfarin-prescription-management-and-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/coumadin-warfarin-prescription-management-and-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>Coumadin generally
Coumadin (generic name warfarin) is a prescription drug that&amp;rsquo;s a blood thinner, or anticoagulant. Warfarin has been around since the 1940s and works by reducing the formation of blood clots.
Doctors frequently write long-term prescriptions for coumadin to prevent heart attacks, strokes, or other cardiovascular conditions.
Coumadin/warfarin use doesn&amp;rsquo;t come without risks, though. The most prominent risks are that it can decrease the body&amp;rsquo;s ability to stop internal bleeding and even cause death if the dosage is incorrect.</description></item><item><title>Neurologist roles and neurology medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/neurologist-roles-and-neurology-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/neurologist-roles-and-neurology-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>Neurologists are doctors with specialized training to diagnose and treat brain, spinal cord, and nervous system disorders.
Primary care physicians or hospitalists frequently make referrals or order consultations to neurologists to work up potential issues.
The standard of care requires neurologists to make a careful evaluation of patients using a thorough physical exam and tests that show whether the patient has a normal neurological function. These tests include things such as carnial nerves, reflexes, motor strength movement, sensation, and balance.</description></item><item><title>How does a workersâ€™ compensation lien work in a medical malpractice case?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-does-a-workers%C3%A2-compensation-lien-work-in-a-medical-malpractice-case/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-does-a-workers%C3%A2-compensation-lien-work-in-a-medical-malpractice-case/</guid><description>Texas law is extreme when it comes to handling medical malpractice lawsuit settlements where any insurance company has paid out any funds related to the claim. As you might expect in our current tort reform environment, the law is overly-generous to workers&amp;rsquo; compensation carriers who can show up after a recovery to demand a cut.
Overall, workers&amp;rsquo; compensation is a good insurance benefit for employees. It&amp;rsquo;s a strict liability system where a subscribing employee&amp;rsquo;s insurance company is on the hook for unlimited medical expenses and certain wage benefits for an employee&amp;rsquo;s compensable injuries that occurred in the course and scope of employment.</description></item><item><title>Two questions to ask before hiring a Texas medical malpractice lawyer</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/two-questions-to-ask-before-hiring-a-texas-medical-malpractice-lawyer/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/two-questions-to-ask-before-hiring-a-texas-medical-malpractice-lawyer/</guid><description>There are two important questions that I think every person looking to hire a Texas medical malpractice lawyer should ask every attorney they are considering. Here are the questions:
(1) What is your personal experience in handling Texas medical malpractice cases?

They form when there&amp;rsquo;s unrelieved external pressure that cuts off blood supply to tissue, killing cells and leading to ulcers.
When bedsores develop in hospitalized patients, they lead to longer stays. In severe cases, they trigger complications such as infection and sepsis that can kill a person.
Medical studies have shown that there are several risk factors that increase the likelihood that a person may develop bedsores:</description></item><item><title>The most common types of pediatrician medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-most-common-types-of-pediatrician-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-most-common-types-of-pediatrician-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>Pediatricians have the complex job of treating patients from newborns to age 18. The American Academy of Pediatrics has published data that provide some useful insights on medical malpractice statistics.
Common types of pediatric medical malpractice
The five most common medical conditions in malpractice cases are related to:
&amp;bull; Brain-damaged babies: Some cases of birth-related brain injuries are diagnosed immediately upon delivery. Other cases may be a bit more subtle. When pediatricians take over the baby&amp;rsquo;s care immediately upon birth, they need to be attentive for signs of a brain injury.</description></item><item><title>Colorectal cancer awareness and medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/colorectal-cancer-awareness-and-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/colorectal-cancer-awareness-and-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>March is Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, a time set aside to raise awareness of a group of different cancers affecting the colorectal tract. Lumped together, colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer in the world.
In adults, the colorectal tract is nearly five feet in length. It has lots of segments, including the ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoid colon.

Fortunately, this time common sense prevailed.
In Harris County Hospital District v. McNew, a hospital worker did her job in a private administrative office that was off-limits to patients. The office was located next door to a radiation-emitting device.

When looking at all medical specialties, orthopedic surgeons are the second-most often named as defendants in medical malpractice lawsuits.
The most common allegations for substandard care against orthopedic surgeons include:
&amp;bull; Mistakes in performing the surgery itself account for 85% of orthopedic surgery medical negligence claims. This is a broad category and includes allegations such as an unintended nerve or vascular injury during surgery or placing the wrong size prosthesis (for example, hip or knee), which can cause stability problems or failure of the surgery.</description></item><item><title>Nursing home patient dies from bone-deep bedsores, urinary tract infection, and sepsis</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/nursing-home-patient-dies-from-bone-deep-bedsores-urinary-tract-infection-and-sepsis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/nursing-home-patient-dies-from-bone-deep-bedsores-urinary-tract-infection-and-sepsis/</guid><description>We occasionally get questions about recommending a good nursing home for someone.

It&amp;rsquo;s potentially dangerous when it&amp;rsquo;s not promptly diagnosed and treated because the skull only has so much room. Anything that occupies that precious space, including fluid, causes an increase in intracranial pressure and the brain itself to shift positions. In the worst cases, the brain is squeezed down through the back of the skull in a deadly situation called brain herniation.</description></item><item><title>Study uncovers the most common types of surgical medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/study-uncovers-the-most-common-types-of-surgical-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/study-uncovers-the-most-common-types-of-surgical-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>As a former hospital administrator, I know that one of the best information tools available to hospital leaders interested in improving patient care and safety is to study past events of poor care.
Accreditation standards require all hospitals&amp;nbsp;to do this. Under certain circumstances, hospitals are required to perform a root cause analysis and document a plan on how to prevent the same error from occurring in the future.
Unfortunately, the powerful hospital lobbyists convinced Texas legislators to grant broad privileges to hospitals to keep this information secret from the public, including attorneys, parties to litigation, and courts.</description></item><item><title>Surgeons &amp; operating room nurses shouldn't leave surgical items inside patients after a procedure</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surgeons-operating-room-nurses-shouldnt-leave-surgical-items-inside-patients-after-a-procedure/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surgeons-operating-room-nurses-shouldnt-leave-surgical-items-inside-patients-after-a-procedure/</guid><description>It seems pretty obvious.
When the operating room (OR) team performs a surgery on a patient, the surgeons and nurses shouldn&amp;rsquo;t leave items in the patient&amp;rsquo;s body.
As a former hospital administrator, I know that hospital accrediting organizations, such as The Joint Commission, refer to these situations as &amp;ldquo;never events.&amp;rdquo; Yet, in my experience, they happen a lot more frequently than you might think. In fact, the medical community has come up with a preferred term, &amp;ldquo;retained surgical item&amp;rdquo; (RSI) to try and obscure what they&amp;rsquo;re talking about.</description></item><item><title>The three most common types of anesthesiology medical malpractice in Texas</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-three-most-common-types-of-anesthesiology-medical-malpractice-in-texas/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-three-most-common-types-of-anesthesiology-medical-malpractice-in-texas/</guid><description>In my view, anesthesiology is one of the most demanding medical specialties. Anesthesiologists put patients to sleep so they can&amp;rsquo;t experience pain, but they can&amp;rsquo;t over-sedate them without risking being able to bring them back.
Unfortunately, the practice of anesthesia medicine has gone in the wrong direction. Insurance companies, lobbyists, and others have pushed for increasing rights and recognitions for lesser-trained nurse anesthetists. In fact, in Texas, these certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) largely run the show in most operating rooms (ORs), with one anesthesiologist in the hallway supervising the work of up to five CRNAs in five different operating rooms at once.</description></item><item><title>Texas Supreme Court releases two anti-plaintiff medical malpractice opinions in one day</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-supreme-court-releases-two-anti-plaintiff-medical-malpractice-opinions-in-one-day/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-supreme-court-releases-two-anti-plaintiff-medical-malpractice-opinions-in-one-day/</guid><description>The Texas Supreme Court was on a roll last week in entering decisions that are unfriendly to patients and plaintiffs in medical malpractice cases.

Hint: Experience matters.
I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered many attorneys with little to no experience in medical malpractice law who tried to dabble in these complex cases.

Unfortunately, Elaine&amp;rsquo;s management approach isn&amp;rsquo;t purely fictional. In healthcare settings, some hospital leaders follow the Elaine approach when it comes to dangerous doctors.
When hospital quality improvement or medical peer review activities uncover problems with surgeons or physicians, spineless hospital leaders work out sweetheart deals with the doctors involved to let them go to another hospital rather than face medical staff discipline.</description></item><item><title>The peril of automatically blaming concerning signs and symptoms on narcotic medication effect</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-peril-of-automatically-blaming-concerning-signs-and-symptoms-on-narcotic-medication-effect/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-peril-of-automatically-blaming-concerning-signs-and-symptoms-on-narcotic-medication-effect/</guid><description>When a hospitalized patient is recovering from a surgery, there must be a careful balance between pain control and over-medication, which can mask signs and symptoms that there&amp;rsquo;s a serious complication.

One of them, in my experience and opinion, is not the quality of care provided by Texas physicians.</description></item><item><title>What you should know about the common mistakes involving radiology scans</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-you-should-know-about-the-common-mistakes-involving-radiology-scans/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-you-should-know-about-the-common-mistakes-involving-radiology-scans/</guid><description>When doctors, physician&amp;rsquo;s assistants, or nurse practitioners order a diagnostic radiology study, such as an MRI or CT scan, it&amp;rsquo;s based on a clinical indication.
The clinical indication on a radiology order is important
The clinical indication refers to the clinical situation that&amp;rsquo;s the reason for the study&amp;nbsp;and is typically the only clinical information that&amp;rsquo;s provided to the radiologist.
For example, if a patient arrived at the emergency room (ER) with symptoms that make the physician suspect stroke, the clinical indication may be &amp;ldquo;stroke.</description></item><item><title>Can defendants use social media as evidence in a Texas medical malpractice lawsuit?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/can-defendants-use-social-media-as-evidence-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-lawsuit/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/can-defendants-use-social-media-as-evidence-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-lawsuit/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s face it.

One of the important safety considerations during prenatal care is for the doctor to obtain a complete list of all prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, and supplements that the mom is taking.
Some medications and supplements are safe to take during pregnancy. Others aren&amp;rsquo;t and can cause birth defects, brain injuries, or other serious medical conditions.</description></item><item><title>Dallas court of appeals defines when a hospital or doctor's duty to disclose malpractice ends</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/dallas-court-of-appeals-defines-when-a-hospital-or-doctors-duty-to-disclose-malpractice-ends/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/dallas-court-of-appeals-defines-when-a-hospital-or-doctors-duty-to-disclose-malpractice-ends/</guid><description>A statute of limitations is a law that limits the amount of time that a plaintiff has to file a particular type of case.

Medical malpractice is a type of negligence. Any negligence claim requires the plaintiff to prove four things: (1) existence of a duty; (2) breach of a duty; (3) proximate cause; and (4) harm.
In the context of health care, the existence of duty is pretty much a given.</description></item><item><title>Cephalopelvic disproportion diagnosis, treatment, and medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/cephalopelvic-disproportion-diagnosis-treatment-and-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/cephalopelvic-disproportion-diagnosis-treatment-and-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>One of the potential pregnancy and birth dangers that OB/GYN doctors and labor and delivery nurses need to look out for is if the baby&amp;rsquo;s head is too big to pass through the mom&amp;rsquo;s birth canal.

As I read the news story, I immediately thought to myself that I bet two things were involved. Sadly, I was correct on both of them.
Office-based versus hospital operating rooms
First, I guessed right that the breast augmentation surgery was done at an office-based plastic surgery center instead of a hospital.</description></item><item><title>Texas Supreme Court order reins in medical malpractice discovery stays</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-supreme-court-order-reins-in-medical-malpractice-discovery-stays/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-supreme-court-order-reins-in-medical-malpractice-discovery-stays/</guid><description>One of the major aims of Texas tort reform law (Texas Medical Liability Act) is to make it difficult for injured patients and their families to sue doctors and hospitals.

Unlike most other areas of medicine, the results of these elective procedures are often inherently subjective. In other words, the patient may have certain appearance-enhancing ideas in mind that the surgeon can claim, after the fact, were impossible, impractical, or certainly not the standard of care.
On the topic of the standard of care, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons is, in my view, notorious for refusing to even define standards of care applicable to plastic and cosmetic surgeons.</description></item><item><title>STEMI heart attack signs, symptoms, treatment, and medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/stemi-heart-attack-signs-symptoms-treatment-and-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/stemi-heart-attack-signs-symptoms-treatment-and-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>Having a heart attack is something that everyone fears.
As it turns out, there are various different types of heart attacks, also called myocardial infarctions or MIs. One type in particular, though, especially worries physicians and even cardiologists (heart specialists). It&amp;rsquo;s called the ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction, or STEMI.
The front-line tool that physicians use to check cardiac function is the 12-lead EKG (or ECG). For this noninvasive, painless test, a doctor or nurse places 12 different wired electrical leads in certain positions on the patient&amp;rsquo;s body.</description></item><item><title>How do you select the defendants to sue in a Texas medical malpractice case?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-do-you-select-the-defendants-to-sue-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-case/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-do-you-select-the-defendants-to-sue-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-case/</guid><description>Proving medical negligence requires defining a standard of care, demonstrating that a physician, nurse, or hospital didn&amp;rsquo;t meet that standard, and that the poor care caused harm to the patient. Without each and every one of these elements, there&amp;rsquo;s not a valid case.

Breast augmentation isn&amp;rsquo;t considered permanent. In fact, most plastic surgeons and manufacturers recommend replacing breast implants every 8-10 years because of normal wear and tear, the possibility of leak or rupture, and contracture of scar tissue. Of course, many patients don&amp;rsquo;t have problems with their breast implants in the first 10 years and keep them in place for a longer period of time.</description></item><item><title>Can I change what I said during my deposition in Texas?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/can-i-change-what-i-said-during-my-deposition-in-texas/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/can-i-change-what-i-said-during-my-deposition-in-texas/</guid><description>There are two types of testimony that are admissible during trial in Texas courts: live testimony and deposition testimony.

Deposition testimony, on the other hand, is obtained before trial.

An incidental durotomy occurs when there is accidental damage, laceration, or puncturing of the protective covering of the spinal cord. It places patients at increased risk for leaking cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and can cause neurological symptoms including a headache that can be uncontrollable if the person isn&amp;rsquo;t lying completely flat.</description></item><item><title>Texas doctors can't immediately abandon or drop their patients, but learn what they're allowed to do</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-doctors-cant-immediately-abandon-or-drop-their-patients-but-learn-what-theyre-allowed-to-do/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-doctors-cant-immediately-abandon-or-drop-their-patients-but-learn-what-theyre-allowed-to-do/</guid><description>From time to time, people call Painter Law Firm with concerns over being abandoned or dropped by their doctors.

Doctor-patient relationships aren&amp;rsquo;t automatic
The general rule in Texas is that the professional relationship between a physician and a patient is voluntary, based on a written or oral contract. Most of the time, the relationship is based on fee for service, whether the patient is paying out-of-pocket or through insurance.</description></item><item><title>Providence Health Center in Waco hit with Medicare quality of care violation in 2019</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/providence-health-center-in-waco-hit-with-medicare-quality-of-care-violation-in-2019/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/providence-health-center-in-waco-hit-with-medicare-quality-of-care-violation-in-2019/</guid><description>Although we are based in Houston, Texas, Painter Law Firm handles medical malpractice cases all over the State of Texas, including those involving care at Providence Health Center, In Waco.

Change of nursing shifts
For hospitalized patients, the most frequent transition in care is the change of nursing shifts.

This is a phenomenon called patient shaming, and it&amp;rsquo;s extremely dangerous to patient safety.

Normally, the baby&amp;rsquo;s spine closes during the first month of pregnancy, but a neural tube defect prevents that from happening in spina bifida cases.
Because spina bifida is a progressive disease, the potential neurological injuries that it can cause to a baby who&amp;rsquo;s still in the womb don&amp;rsquo;t happen all at once.</description></item><item><title>Can a defendant use my social media posts against me in a Texas medical malpractice lawsuit?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/can-a-defendant-use-my-social-media-posts-against-me-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-lawsuit/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/can-a-defendant-use-my-social-media-posts-against-me-in-a-texas-medical-malpractice-lawsuit/</guid><description>The short answer is &amp;ldquo;yes,&amp;rdquo; if you let them.

Consent forms are often included in a huge stack of paperwork that a doctor&amp;rsquo;s front-office worker, receptionist, or nurse has a patient fill out before being seen by a doctor. The purpose of consent forms is to make an attempt to comply with the requirement of Texas law for physicians to obtain informed consent.</description></item><item><title>Dermatologist ignores suspicious spot on skin, man is later diagnosed with malignant melanoma</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/dermatologist-ignores-suspicious-spot-on-skin-man-is-later-diagnosed-with-malignant-melanoma/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/dermatologist-ignores-suspicious-spot-on-skin-man-is-later-diagnosed-with-malignant-melanoma/</guid><description>Based on my experience as a Houston, Texas medical malpractice lawyer, I think it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea for every adult to have an established relationship with a dermatologist.

Everyone agrees that stroke care is time sensitive and that people should get to the emergency room (ER) at the first sign of trouble. Yet, those patients who make it to the ER with early symptoms that come and go are often discharged without much of a workup. This can lead to misdiagnosis, lack of treatment, a massive stroke, and a medical malpractice lawsuit.</description></item><item><title>What you should know about emergency room triage and medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-you-should-know-about-emergency-room-triage-and-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-you-should-know-about-emergency-room-triage-and-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>When patients arrive at a hospital emergency room (ER), they&amp;rsquo;re usually first seen and assessed by a triage nurse. A triage nurse is a registered nurse who uses a system called the emergency severity index (ESI) to decide and prioritize which patients need to be seen first by an ER physician.
Emergency rooms tend to be busy, so triage nurses perform a critical function.

With any surgery, there is an expectation that a patient will have some degree of pain. Thorough, accurate pain assessments that are properly documented establish a baseline that doctors and nurses can refer to when determining whether the patient is improving, getting worse, or staying the same.

While most of us tend to take anesthesia for granted these days, it certainly doesn&amp;rsquo;t come without risks. That&amp;rsquo;s why a thorough pre-anesthesia assessment is part of the standard of care and is critical to the safety of the patient facing the surgery requiring general anesthesia.
Before getting into the ins and outs of the pre-anesthesia assessment, we should first discuss who it is that will actually be doing the assessment and providing anesthesia services.</description></item><item><title>Should I get a copy of my medical records before I leave a Texas hospital, if I think there was medical malpractice?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/should-i-get-a-copy-of-my-medical-records-before-i-leave-a-texas-hospital-if-i-think-there-was-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/should-i-get-a-copy-of-my-medical-records-before-i-leave-a-texas-hospital-if-i-think-there-was-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>If you have questions about the quality of care that was provided to you during hospitalization, I strongly recommend obtaining a copy of your medical records before leaving the Texas hospital. When you ask for the records, be sure to emphasize that you want all of them.
Many hospital records offices seem to think that patients are only interested in physician notes. Oftentimes, though, some of the most useful information may be contained elsewhere, in places like nursing notes, flow sheets, laboratory reports, and radiology reports.</description></item><item><title>Intubation, esophageal intubation, and breathing tube/airway medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/intubation-esophageal-intubation-and-breathing-tube/airway-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/intubation-esophageal-intubation-and-breathing-tube/airway-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>Intubation is a medical procedure that&amp;rsquo;s routine in hospital settings. It involves placing a plastic breathing tube through a patient&amp;rsquo;s mouth down into the trachea (windpipe) to secure the airway. Successful intubation ensures that there&amp;rsquo;s no obstruction that prevents the patient from being able to breathe and ventilate.
Emergency physicians and pulmonologists perform intubations in the emergency room (ER) when patients arrive unconscious or having a seizure. In the operating room, anesthesiologists or certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) intubate patients before surgery when general anesthesia will be used.</description></item><item><title>Retinal detachment symptoms, risks, and medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/retinal-detachment-symptoms-risks-and-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/retinal-detachment-symptoms-risks-and-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>The way eye care is provided in the United States is rather complicated.
You go to the optometrist for basic checkups and to get prescriptions for glasses or contact lenses, which are made by opticians. Ophthalmologists are medical doctors who treat diseases of the eyes. Vision insurance covers eye exams and lenses, but medical insurance gets tapped for diseases or medical conditions of the eyes.
Of all the bad things that can happen to the eyes, retinal detachment has to be near the top of the list.</description></item><item><title>New Texas law restores common sense, will benefit some medical medical malpractice victims</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/new-texas-law-restores-common-sense-will-benefit-some-medical-medical-malpractice-victims/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/new-texas-law-restores-common-sense-will-benefit-some-medical-medical-malpractice-victims/</guid><description>Sometimes the Texas legislature writes laws that are unclear.

The first cap applies to all medical malpractice cases, whether a death is involved or not. Texas law imposes a cap on non-economic damages. Non-economic damages are those serious, yet intangible, injuries including pain-and-suffering, mental anguish, physical impairment, physical disfigurement, and even the loss of a loved one.</description></item><item><title>Poor nursing communication tied to death of mother hours after delivery of her baby</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/poor-nursing-communication-tied-to-death-of-mother-hours-after-delivery-of-her-baby/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/poor-nursing-communication-tied-to-death-of-mother-hours-after-delivery-of-her-baby/</guid><description>There&amp;rsquo;s a heartbreaking trend going on in America now.

Surgeons often describe the benefits of these procedures to include leaving fewer scars, being less invasive, having a faster recovery time, and reducing postoperative pain.
Laparoscopic techniques are recommended and preferred by most surgeons for a variety of surgeries including weight loss/bariatric procedures, gallbladder removal (cholecystectomy), abdominal hernia repairs, appendix removal (appendectomy), and even female sterilization.
From my experience as a Houston, Texas medical malpractice attorney, I believe that some surgeons leave out the risks when discussing these modern techniques.</description></item><item><title>Change in behavior can be an important sign of a dangerous infection in seniors</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/change-in-behavior-can-be-an-important-sign-of-a-dangerous-infection-in-seniors/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/change-in-behavior-can-be-an-important-sign-of-a-dangerous-infection-in-seniors/</guid><description>Any time someone starts behaving funny&amp;mdash;and by that, I mean in some way that&amp;rsquo;s unusual for them&amp;mdash;it&amp;rsquo;s not something to laugh at.

In time, the focus naturally shifts to finding the best care possible for your baby. Some babies may have profound brain injuries that will require a lifetime of round-the-clock care.

In order to link or connect the sub-standard care or medical mistake to the patient&amp;rsquo;s injuries, the plaintiff has to provide enough evidence to satisfy a legal standard called proximate causation.</description></item><item><title>Federal report: MD Anderson Cancer Center patient dies after tainted blood transfusion</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/federal-report-md-anderson-cancer-center-patient-dies-after-tainted-blood-transfusion/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/federal-report-md-anderson-cancer-center-patient-dies-after-tainted-blood-transfusion/</guid><description>The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center was in the news recently after a patient died from a transfusion with a contaminated blood product.

Under current Texas tort reform laws, non-economic damages are capped. Non-economic damages are often the most significant damages to a plaintiff and include things like mental anguish, physical impairment, pain and suffering, and the loss of a relationship or consortium.
The amount of the non-economic damages depends on who is sued. If only physicians or other human-being healthcare providers are named as defendants in a medical malpractice lawsuit, the total non-economic damages cap is $250,000.</description></item><item><title>Hospital supplied recalled battery for spine simulator surgery, appellate court clears way for case to proceed</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/hospital-supplied-recalled-battery-for-spine-simulator-surgery-appellate-court-clears-way-for-case-to-proceed/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/hospital-supplied-recalled-battery-for-spine-simulator-surgery-appellate-court-clears-way-for-case-to-proceed/</guid><description>As a Houston, Texas medical malpractice attorney, I&amp;rsquo;ve heard all kinds of healthcare defendant excuses and arguments over why they think cases are frivolous or should be thrown out right out of the gate.

These individuals are called wrongful death beneficiaries and under Texas law they&amp;rsquo;re limited to the surviving parents, spouse, and children of the deceased person.
A surviving spouse can be from a traditional ceremonial marriage or a common law marriage.

The general statute of limitations for adults is two years from the date of the alleged negligence. Children who are less than 12 years old at the time of the negligence have until their 14th birthday to file suit.
Unfortunately, some people wait too long hoping to heal or get better and lose the opportunity to pursure their potential medical malpractice claims.</description></item><item><title>Unnecessary episiotomy medical malpractice in Texas</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/unnecessary-episiotomy-medical-malpractice-in-texas/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/unnecessary-episiotomy-medical-malpractice-in-texas/</guid><description>Before 2006, many obstetrician/gynecologist (OB/GYN) physicians routinely made a surgical cut, called an episiotomy, at the opening of the vagina. Many surgeons were taught that a precise surgical cut would heal better than a natural tear that might happen as the baby passes through the birth canal.
The standard of care has changed, though, and now discourages OB/GYN doctors from routinely performing episiotomies. Mounting evidence shows that the painful procedure often causes more trouble than benefits for women.</description></item><item><title>Compare birth-related complication rates of 18 Houston hospitals</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/compare-birth-related-complication-rates-of-18-houston-hospitals/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/compare-birth-related-complication-rates-of-18-houston-hospitals/</guid><description>Hospitals usually like to keep the public in the dark about bad outcomes, complications, or problems that occur.

The textbook sign of preeclampsia is pregnancy-related high blood pressure (hypertension). Some people describe it as a silent killer because no one can feel the increase in blood pressure. That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s so important for every pregnant mom to get prenatal care with a competent OB/GYN physician early and consistently throughout pregnancy.</description></item><item><title>The secret deadly risks of plastic &amp; cosmetic surgery: What you should know</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-secret-deadly-risks-of-plastic-cosmetic-surgery-what-you-should-know/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-secret-deadly-risks-of-plastic-cosmetic-surgery-what-you-should-know/</guid><description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know about you, but we get a lot of local or community magazines in the mail at our house.

Sometimes the Chapter 74 reports are from multiple physicians.</description></item><item><title>FDA cautions that robotic surgery is unproven and potentially dangerous for cancer surgeries</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/fda-cautions-that-robotic-surgery-is-unproven-and-potentially-dangerous-for-cancer-surgeries/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/fda-cautions-that-robotic-surgery-is-unproven-and-potentially-dangerous-for-cancer-surgeries/</guid><description>The men and women in suits who run hospitals love to advertise when their facilities offer robotic surgery. In many cases, they suggest that robotic surgery offers greater safety and other benefits to patients when compared to conventional surgical procedures.
It&amp;rsquo;s understandable that they want to recover the significant investment required to purchase robotic surgical equipment. Yet, a growing body of research shows that claims about the superiority of robotic surgery aren&amp;rsquo;t backed up by any evidence.</description></item><item><title>Federal report: Increase in basic errors endangered patients at Baylor St. Luke's Medical Center</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/federal-report-increase-in-basic-errors-endangered-patients-at-baylor-st.-lukes-medical-center/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/federal-report-increase-in-basic-errors-endangered-patients-at-baylor-st.-lukes-medical-center/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;These are really basic errors that I didn&amp;rsquo;t really think happened that often anymore.&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s what Dr. Ashish Jha, a Harvard expert in hospital quality, said after reviewing the latest federal government report that&amp;#39;s critical of CHI St. Luke&amp;rsquo;s Health Baylor St. Luke&amp;rsquo;s Medical Center.

Most of the time, cerebral palsy is caused by a brain injury before birth or during labor and delivery.
Sometimes the signs and symptoms of cerebral palsy are obvious at birth, but on other occasions they become noticeable between infancy and kindergarten. Look for movement-related symptoms like floppy or rigid arms and legs, floppy or rigid trunk, unusual reflexes, abnormal posture, unsteady gait or walking, swallowing issues, and irregular eye movements.</description></item><item><title>Beaumont man dies from hospital-acquired infection during treatment from car wreck injuries</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/beaumont-man-dies-from-hospital-acquired-infection-during-treatment-from-car-wreck-injuries/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/beaumont-man-dies-from-hospital-acquired-infection-during-treatment-from-car-wreck-injuries/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m working on a case in Beaumont, Texas dealing with the wrongful death of a middle-aged man.

Radiologists are specially trained to interpret all kinds of diagnostic imaging, from x-rays to CT scans, from MRIs to angiograms.

Under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, parties don&amp;rsquo;t have a choice about responding. While some hospitals and doctors try to stonewall patients seeking information, once a lawsuit is filed it&amp;rsquo;s a different story.
Written discovery typically starts with requests for disclosure, which require each side to produce standard information, including relevant medical and billing records and documentation showing medical malpractice insurance policy limits.</description></item><item><title>Breast cancer after a negative mammogram</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/breast-cancer-after-a-negative-mammogram/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/breast-cancer-after-a-negative-mammogram/</guid><description>A mammogram is a specialized x-ray scan of the breasts used to look for breast cancer.

&amp;bull; Ages 45-54 should have a mammogram every year.

Common GI complaints include abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing, nausea and vomiting, and just an overall difficulty in keeping food or liquids down. These types of symptoms can develop on their own, or after an abdominal surgery like a hiatal hernia repair or bariatric procedure.</description></item><item><title>Three steps you can take to prevent pharmacy errors</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/three-steps-you-can-take-to-prevent-pharmacy-errors/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/three-steps-you-can-take-to-prevent-pharmacy-errors/</guid><description>Pharmacy medication mistakes happen more often than you might think.

It&amp;rsquo;s the physician&amp;rsquo;s obligation to get a thorough medical history from you, followed by a detailed exam and any necessary testing, like lab work or radiology scans. At that point, the standard of care requires the doctor to form a differential diagnosis.
A differential diagnosis is a list of all medical conditions that may explain a patient&amp;rsquo;s symptoms, as well as the signs and findings identified during the physical exam and through any testing.</description></item><item><title>Texas court shoots down patient's argument that physician fraudulent concealment should extend statute of limitations</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-court-shoots-down-patients-argument-that-physician-fraudulent-concealment-should-extend-statute-of-limitations/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-court-shoots-down-patients-argument-that-physician-fraudulent-concealment-should-extend-statute-of-limitations/</guid><description>Every week, someone calls Painter Law Firm to ask for legal help for injuries from medical malpractice that occurred three, four, or even 10 years ago.

It&amp;rsquo;s preferable, when possible, to do that investigation before filing a lawsuit. By doing the advance work during the pre-suit period, you can stay in control and develop your case in a way that puts you ahead of the defendants from the start.
It&amp;rsquo;s best for an experienced medical malpractice attorney to have at least six months before the statute of limitations to investigate the case.</description></item><item><title>There's a big reason why you should always get a copy of your medical records before leaving the hospital</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/theres-a-big-reason-why-you-should-always-get-a-copy-of-your-medical-records-before-leaving-the-hospital/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/theres-a-big-reason-why-you-should-always-get-a-copy-of-your-medical-records-before-leaving-the-hospital/</guid><description>My legal nurse and I spent a lot of time looking at my clients&amp;rsquo; medical records.

Most of the rush is related to money rather than sound financial reason, and is pushed by health insurance companies and government payors like Medicare and Medicaid.
In many ways, insurance and government payor &amp;ldquo;bean counters&amp;rdquo; and accountants have successfully wrestled away medical decision-making from doctors.</description></item><item><title>Who can I sue for a drug interaction or side effect?

Under this court-created precedent, Texas hospitals are not allowed to employ physicians.
Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, Texas hospitals have figured out a lot of ways to skirt the corporate practice of medicine doctrine. Many of them have formed separate organizations that they control, which, in turn, employ physicians.
This murky issue is always difficult for doctors from other states to understand, because virtually all of them are hospital employees.</description></item><item><title>Intubation, extubation, and anesthesia medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/intubation-extubation-and-anesthesia-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/intubation-extubation-and-anesthesia-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>As a Houston, Texas medical malpractice attorney, I&amp;rsquo;ve handled a lot of cases and lawsuits involving mistakes by anesthesiologists and certified registered nurse anesthesiologists (CRNAs).
There are a handful of common issues that I see over and over again in anesthesia cases. Some involve the anesthesia provider going through the motions before a procedure, rather than doing a comprehensive pre-anesthesia evaluation to identify and prepare for any areas of concern.

Ambulatory surgery centers are outpatient facilities that were originally designed to allow surgeons to benefit financially from the lucrative facility fee charges that would otherwise go to hospitals.

In many types of cases, attorneys are able to file a lawsuit quickly and conduct most of the investigation while the matter is pending in court.

When sepsis advances to the point that it causes vital organ damage and even death, it&amp;rsquo;s called septic shock.
Sometimes infections are caused by&amp;nbsp;negligent medical care and sometimes they&amp;rsquo;re not.
For example, I&amp;rsquo;ve handled many medical negligence cases where patients had a perforated bowel or stomach as a surgical complication. When the surgeon doesn&amp;rsquo;t recognize and repair the hole, the contents of those organs leak into the abdominal cavity and cause an infection that leads to sepsis.</description></item><item><title>New standards target pain management, opioid use at facilities</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/new-standards-target-pain-management-opioid-use-at-facilities/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/new-standards-target-pain-management-opioid-use-at-facilities/</guid><description>Medical and nursing pain management receives significant attention because of the opioid crisis.

Not every medical error is negligence
First, not all medical errors amount to medical negligence.

Figuring out the exact date that the statute of limitations expires under Texas law for a medical negligence case is sometimes complex.
A good starting place is that general statute of limitations in Texas for medical negligence cases is two years after the date of the negligent act or omission by a health care provider.

The first question is whether there was a medical mistake or error that amounts to medical negligence. This is a question for a medical expert to help answer, in conjunction with the attorney.

Each state has a wrongful death statute that defines who&amp;rsquo;s eligible to be a plaintiff in a wrongful death lawsuit. In Texas, wrongful death plaintiffs are limited to the surviving spouse, children, and parents of the deceased person.
It&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon that the rather narrow Texas wrongful death statute means that no one can file a wrongful death lawsuit in certain cases.</description></item><item><title>Does the Texas willful and wanton standard for ER medical malpractice cases apply to both hospitals and urgent care or freestanding emergency rooms?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/does-the-texas-willful-and-wanton-standard-for-er-medical-malpractice-cases-apply-to-both-hospitals-and-urgent-care-or-freestanding-emergency-rooms/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/does-the-texas-willful-and-wanton-standard-for-er-medical-malpractice-cases-apply-to-both-hospitals-and-urgent-care-or-freestanding-emergency-rooms/</guid><description>In most Texas medical malpractice cases, a plaintiff (patient) only needs to prove negligence. When bona fide emergency medical care is the subject of the medical malpractice, though, there are some additional considerations.
Depending on the circumstances, Texas law may require a higher standard of proof called &amp;ldquo;willful and wanton negligence.&amp;rdquo; The Texas Supreme Court has interpreted willful and wanton negligence as being equivalent to gross negligence. Regardless of what you call it, it&amp;rsquo;s a tough standard that requires careful investigation and workup by an experienced Texas medical malpractice attorney.</description></item><item><title>What are developmental milestones, and how do I know if my child is hitting them?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-are-developmental-milestones-and-how-do-i-know-if-my-child-is-hitting-them/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-are-developmental-milestones-and-how-do-i-know-if-my-child-is-hitting-them/</guid><description>Just like it&amp;rsquo;s important to have good, regular prenatal care when a mom is pregnant, it&amp;rsquo;s important to take your baby or child in for regular appointments with a pediatrician.

Typically, multiple errors committed by multiple individuals contribute to the bad outcome.
Texas law recognizes that there can be more than one proximate cause of a serious injury or wrongful death. Thus, when preparing a medical negligence case for trial, Painter Law Firm hires the medical and nursing experts necessary to testify how each defendant&amp;rsquo;s substandard healthcare contributed to the patient&amp;rsquo;s injuries or death.</description></item><item><title>What to do when you think thereâ€™s a hospital cover-up</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-to-do-when-you-think-there%C3%A2s-a-hospital-cover-up/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-to-do-when-you-think-there%C3%A2s-a-hospital-cover-up/</guid><description>I frequently have conversations with clients who have a gut feeling that their doctors, nurses, and hospital representatives aren&amp;rsquo;t being totally honest with them.

It&amp;rsquo;s sometimes describes as violating the standard of care&amp;mdash;what the healthcare provider is expected to do under similar circumstances.
Not all medical malpractice is negligence, though.&amp;nbsp;Negligence is medical malpractice where the mistake or error harmed the patient. Under Texas law, a plaintiff files a negligence lawsuit to recover for medical malpractice.

Common diagnostic radiology scans include MRIs, CTs, ultrasounds, MR angiograms, and CT angiograms.
Physicians who specialize in reading or interpreting radiology scans are called radiologists. Doctors who specialize in radiology scans of the brain, head, and neck are called neuroradiologists.
As a Houston, Texas, medical malpractice lawyer, I see two common mistakes by radiologists and neuroradiologists. Both can cause devastating outcomes for patients.</description></item><item><title>The hospital never explained the risks of a surgical procedure, and I was severely injured during surgery.

Our investigation uncovered that her surgeon never had a true informed consent conversation with her. If he had done so, there was no way she would have agreed to proceed with surgery.
Informed consent means the doctor must give enough information to the patient for the patient to consent, or give permission, for the treatment or surgery.</description></item><item><title>How long does it take to litigate a medical malpractice case in Texas?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-long-does-it-take-to-litigate-a-medical-malpractice-case-in-texas/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/how-long-does-it-take-to-litigate-a-medical-malpractice-case-in-texas/</guid><description>Medical malpractice cases are complicated and have high requirements for experts, evidence, and proof. As a result, they don&amp;rsquo;t typically settle or resolve without a substantial investment of time and resources.
In my experience, district courts in Houston, Harris County, Texas schedule malpractice cases for trial about one year after they are filed. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean the case will be reached, though, because many other cases will be set for the same time.</description></item><item><title>My daughter had a brachial plexus injury after delivery at a Houston, Texas hospital.

Medicaid and Medicare are government programs that provided limited benefits to eligible individuals.
To receive Medicaid benefits, most people must fall below a certain family income level. Medicaid has some waiver opportunities, though, that apply to disabled children.
Most Medicare beneficiaries, on the other hand, are over 65 years old. However, a baby or child with disabilities who is approved for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) qualifies for Medicare after being on SSDI for over 24 months.</description></item><item><title>My Texas doctor prescribed the wrong drug for me.

At Painter Law Firm, we get at least a few calls each month from patients who are understandably angry that they were given the wrong drug. If you were given a prescription for the wrong medication by mistake, but weren&amp;rsquo;t injured because of it, there&amp;rsquo;s no basis for a medical malpractice lawsuit even though the doctor made a medical error.

Providers calculate the due date using the pregnant woman&amp;rsquo;s last menstrual period.
Some women are more precise on providing this information than others, so sometimes the due date is revised. Most providers consider a normal pregnancy to be 38 to 41 weeks, with the average pregnancy lasting nine months, or 40 weeks.</description></item><item><title>What should I do when my doctor says Iâ€™m fine but Iâ€™m not?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-should-i-do-when-my-doctor-says-i%C3%A2m-fine-but-i%C3%A2m-not/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-should-i-do-when-my-doctor-says-i%C3%A2m-fine-but-i%C3%A2m-not/</guid><description>One of the tough things that physicians have to do every day is figure out whether something is wrong with their patients, or if what they&amp;rsquo;re experiencing is within the normal expected range for their condition.

This question comes up a lot with hospitalized patients who died within 24 hours of admission to the hospital. Under Texas law, hospitals must report these deaths to the Medical Examiner&amp;rsquo;s office for investigation. The Medical Examiner may decide that an autopsy is necessary to determine the cause of death.
In an autopsy a pathologist physician examines the body, often orders blood work for a toxicology screen, and performs other testing to reach an opinion on the cause and manner of death.</description></item><item><title>What is considered medical malpractice in Texas?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-is-considered-medical-malpractice-in-texas/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-is-considered-medical-malpractice-in-texas/</guid><description>The classic legal definition of medical malpractice is that the healthcare provider did or didn&amp;rsquo;t do something that a reasonably prudent healthcare provider would have done or not done in the same or similar circumstances.
Think about it like this.

Studies have shown that there&amp;rsquo;s an uptick in medical errors in hospitals during major holidays like Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year&amp;rsquo;s and even long-weekend holidays like Memorial Day and Labor Day. Another risky time is the month of July, when new doctors fresh out of medical school start their residency training.</description></item><item><title>What should you do if you have a fever or pain during pregnancy?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-should-you-do-if-you-have-a-fever-or-pain-during-pregnancy/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-should-you-do-if-you-have-a-fever-or-pain-during-pregnancy/</guid><description>As a Houston, Texas medical malpractice attorney, I&amp;rsquo;ve investigated and filed a lot of cases involving birth injuries. Through this experience, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed some common themes in these sad and tragic cases.
Labor and delivery birth injuries
In some cases, the babies were injured just before birth because of placenta or other problems that caused fetal distress, leading to a hypoxic/ischemic injury. We call these acute conditions. In this type of injury, there&amp;rsquo;s not enough oxygen getting to the brain and vital organs, which causes permanent damage.</description></item><item><title>What you need to know about Texas hospital liens in car wreck and personal injury claims</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-you-need-to-know-about-texas-hospital-liens-in-car-wreck-and-personal-injury-claims/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-you-need-to-know-about-texas-hospital-liens-in-car-wreck-and-personal-injury-claims/</guid><description>Although I focus my law practice on medical malpractice cases, I occasionally handle car wreck cases for my existing or former clients. I do this to make sure that hospitals and insurance companies don&amp;rsquo;t take advantage of my injured clients.
Over the past year, I&amp;rsquo;ve represented a client who had a botched spine surgery at a northwest Houston hospital. The surgeon&amp;rsquo;s mistakes left him unable to feel anything from the waist down and with difficulty walking and getting around, and also took away his bowel and bladder control.</description></item><item><title>What you should know about primary care providers &amp; medical malpractice</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-you-should-know-about-primary-care-providers-medical-malpractice/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-you-should-know-about-primary-care-providers-medical-malpractice/</guid><description>When I started my graduate career at the Marshall University School of Medicine, in 1992, there was a big emphasis on primary care medicine. Primary care doctors include those who practice in family medicine, pediatrics, and even office-based internal medicine. Where I grew up, in West Virginia, there was a need for more physicians in these practice areas.
Over 25 years later, the medical education community continues to encourage new doctors to pursue a career in primary care.</description></item><item><title>Texas Supreme Court sides with plaintiff in expert report dispute</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-supreme-court-sides-with-plaintiff-in-expert-report-dispute/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-supreme-court-sides-with-plaintiff-in-expert-report-dispute/</guid><description>Most people who come to Painter Law Firm to meet about a potential medical malpractice case are surprised to learn about the burdensome requirements of Texas law to get a case off the ground.

As a Houston, Texas medical malpractice attorney, I have a good feel for how most people do it. They start by looking at who&amp;rsquo;s in-network for their health insurance. Next comes looking for what doctors are nearby. And finally, figure out who will give you an appointment in a reasonable time frame.

Before hospitalists came around, a hospitalized patient&amp;rsquo;s attending physician&amp;mdash;the one with the ultimate decision-making responsibility&amp;mdash;might only be in the hospital once a day for rounds. These days, most hospitals have hospitalists on-site 24/7.

She was taken to the operating room for a laparoscopic appendectomy and then discharged on the same day.</description></item><item><title>Learn the 7 hospital failures that could have avoided a 6-year-old girl's death from sepsis</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/learn-the-7-hospital-failures-that-could-have-avoided-a-6-year-old-girls-death-from-sepsis/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/learn-the-7-hospital-failures-that-could-have-avoided-a-6-year-old-girls-death-from-sepsis/</guid><description>Sepsis is a dangerous inflammatory condition that follows an infection.

The early symptoms of myocarditis are somewhat non-specific, which means that healthcare providers need to pay careful attention to them.</description></item><item><title>Opthalmologist medical malpractice: Eye doctor misdiagnoses serious eye condition</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/opthalmologist-medical-malpractice-eye-doctor-misdiagnoses-serious-eye-condition/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/opthalmologist-medical-malpractice-eye-doctor-misdiagnoses-serious-eye-condition/</guid><description>Have you ever lost a contact lens?

&amp;nbsp;
Texas Civil &amp;amp; Practice Remedies Code, Chapter 74, governs health care liability claims. Many attorneys consider health care liability claims to be synonymous with medical malpractice cases, but the statutory definition is more expansive, and navigating when and how it applies can cause some pitfalls.&amp;nbsp;
Chapter 74 almost always applies
A health care liability claim includes any cause of action against a &amp;ldquo;health care provider or physician for treatment, lack of treatment, or other claim to departure from accepted standards of medical care, or healthcare, or safety or professional or administrative services directly related to healthcare, which proximately results in injury to or death of a claimant, whether the claimant&amp;rsquo;s claim or cause of action sounds in tort or contract.</description></item><item><title>Over 260 patients have died in surgical centers since 2013</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/over-260-patients-have-died-in-surgical-centers-since-2013/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/over-260-patients-have-died-in-surgical-centers-since-2013/</guid><description>If you were given a choice, would you want to have an elective surgery at a facility where they would have to call 911 if something went wrong?

This is the first step in a process that is called medication reconciliation.
At some doctor&amp;rsquo;s offices, clerks hand patients a stack of paperwork to fill out, burying the medication history form among them. Patients can understandably get fatigued after filling out their Social Security number and birthdate on five different forms and may not put much thought into the medication history form.</description></item><item><title>Houston's Park Plaza Hospital has been cited with two Medicare/Medicaid violations so far in 2018</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/houstons-park-plaza-hospital-has-been-cited-with-two-medicare/medicaid-violations-so-far-in-2018/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/houstons-park-plaza-hospital-has-been-cited-with-two-medicare/medicaid-violations-so-far-in-2018/</guid><description>Park Plaza Hospital, located at 1313 Hermann Dr., Houston, TX 77004, near the Texas Medical Center, was recently cited with two violations for quality of care concerns.

While many people may be most familiar with nurse practitioners providing primary care, they also participate in other specialty areas, including post-operative care for surgical patients.
Under Texas law, the Nursing Practice Act refers to nurse practitioners as Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs). While nurse practitioners are allowed to see patients independently, the Nursing Practice Act requires them to have a written collaborative practice agreement with at least one medical doctor.</description></item><item><title>Clear Lake Regional Medical Center medical malpractice attorney/lawyer</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/clear-lake-regional-medical-center-medical-malpractice-attorney/lawyer/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/clear-lake-regional-medical-center-medical-malpractice-attorney/lawyer/</guid><description>As a Houston, Texas medical malpractice lawyer, I handle cases involving hospitals throughout Harris County and the State of Texas.

Hospital-acquired infections

The FDA ordered safety labeling changes for these drugs because of risks that were uncovered under an FDA safety review.

&amp;nbsp;As a Houston, Texas medical malpractice attorney, I can think of many examples, but one, in particular, immediately comes to mind. A woman in her 40s was having an elective upper endoscopy at a Memorial Hermann Hospital in the Houston area. An endoscopy is the procedure where a physician inserts a scope with the camera down the patient&amp;rsquo;s throat to be able to see the esophagus, stomach, and first part of the small intestines (the duodenum).</description></item><item><title>Suing a Texas public hospital for medical negligence requires jumping hurdles</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/suing-a-texas-public-hospital-for-medical-negligence-requires-jumping-hurdles/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/suing-a-texas-public-hospital-for-medical-negligence-requires-jumping-hurdles/</guid><description>In my law practice as a Houston, Texas medical malpractice attorney, I frequently speak with patients who have complaints about the poor care that they received at public hospitals.
There are only limited circumstances in which a patient can sue a public hospital for medical malpractice. Under ancient common-law principles, the government enjoys sovereign immunity from suit.

Healthcare professionals use the term &amp;ldquo;discharge planning&amp;rdquo; to describe the entire process of beginning care all the way through transitioning a patient from hospitalization to discharge to home or another facility.
In many situations that I have seen, hospitals, doctors, nurses, and caseworkers seem to have put very little thought into preparing the patient for a safe discharge.</description></item><item><title>Medicare reveals the seven most common nursing home problems</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/medicare-reveals-the-seven-most-common-nursing-home-problems/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/medicare-reveals-the-seven-most-common-nursing-home-problems/</guid><description>Skilled nursing facilities (often abbreviated as &amp;ldquo;SNF&amp;rdquo;) are designed for patients who are not sick enough to warrant continued admission into a normal acute-care hospital, but who are not well enough to be discharged to home.

In the political climate of the past 10-15 years, Texas intermediate appellate court and Supreme Court opinions have tilted overwhelmingly in favor of defendant hospitals and doctors.
From my experience in staying current on appellate opinions, it seems to me that the Supreme Court and other appellate courts occasionally enter opinions for plaintiffs when healthcare providers and their lawyers are appealing way too many cases on meritless points.</description></item><item><title>Surgeon admits to lying in court to protect colleagueâ€”what you can do to protect yourself</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surgeon-admits-to-lying-in-court-to-protect-colleague%C3%A2what-you-can-do-to-protect-yourself/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surgeon-admits-to-lying-in-court-to-protect-colleague%C3%A2what-you-can-do-to-protect-yourself/</guid><description>As a medical malpractice lawyer, for years I suspected that some doctors bent the truth when they are testifying in a lawsuit.

A common reason that patients hire a medical malpractice attorney to investigate potential surgical malpractice involves unintended injuries during a surgery.
Damaging the structure being operated on

For example, as a result of the 2003 round of tort reform in Texas, there is a heightened standard of proof required for plaintiffs who are the victims of medical malpractice that occurred in a hospital emergency room setting.</description></item><item><title>Study: Few medical students &amp; new doctors are competent in basic clinical skills, like measuring blood pressure</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/study-few-medical-students-new-doctors-are-competent-in-basic-clinical-skills-like-measuring-blood-pressure/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/study-few-medical-students-new-doctors-are-competent-in-basic-clinical-skills-like-measuring-blood-pressure/</guid><description>In the United States, medical school is a four-year program after college. An undergraduate college degree provides no useful training related to caring for patients. Thus, when new doctors are licensed to practice medicine upon graduation from medical school, their knowledge base is obtained in the preceding four-year period.
Speaking from experience, medical students are bombarded with vast amounts of information and new clinical skills that they are expected to master in a short amount of time.</description></item><item><title>What to do when the doctor wants to discharge you from the hospital too quickly</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-to-do-when-the-doctor-wants-to-discharge-you-from-the-hospital-too-quickly/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/what-to-do-when-the-doctor-wants-to-discharge-you-from-the-hospital-too-quickly/</guid><description>One of the interesting things about being a Houston, Texas medical malpractice attorney is that I have the opportunity to spot healthcare trends, based on the type of calls that we receive from potential clients.

Under Texas law, children under the age of 18 years old are considered minors.</description></item><item><title>Two tips to make the transfer from a hospital to a nursing or rehabilitation facility safer</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/two-tips-to-make-the-transfer-from-a-hospital-to-a-nursing-or-rehabilitation-facility-safer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/two-tips-to-make-the-transfer-from-a-hospital-to-a-nursing-or-rehabilitation-facility-safer/</guid><description>As a Texas lawyer who focuses on handling medical malpractice cases for patients, I often have the opportunity to see health care trends and common errors that harm patients.
One of the most dangerous time periods for patient safety, in my experience, is any time that there is a transition in care.

In my opinion, the best way to encourage more conscientious attention to patient safety is through accountability in civil court.</description></item><item><title>The risks of liposuction</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-risks-of-liposuction/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-risks-of-liposuction/</guid><description>Liposuction is the most common cosmetic surgery in the world.
Some people think of it as a weight-loss tool, but most cosmetic surgeons use it for body contouring, by reducing fat deposits in specific localized areas, like parts of the abdomen, thighs, back, arms, calves, upper neck and lower face, chest, and buttocks.
From my experience as a Texas medical malpractice lawyer, I believe that many people are unaware of the serious risks of liposuction.</description></item><item><title>The important nursing role in bedsore prevention</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-important-nursing-role-in-bedsore-prevention/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-important-nursing-role-in-bedsore-prevention/</guid><description>In my career as a Houston medical malpractice attorney, I have represented numerous clients who were seriously injured as a result of pressure ulcers.
Pressure ulcers are also known as bedsores or decubitus ulcers.

Most of these procedures are done for outpatient routine screening purposes in relatively healthy people. Some, though, are to investigate, and sometimes treat, bleeding and digestive issues.
Colonoscopies are procedures where a doctor inserts a flexible scope and camera through your rectum, to be able to inspect the inside of your colon.
In an EGD, also called an upper endoscopy, the doctor inserts the flexible scope and camera down your throat to be able to look inside your upper digestive track, including the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum.</description></item><item><title>The dangerous risks of opioid painkillers like Dilaudid and morphine</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-dangerous-risks-of-opioid-painkillers-like-dilaudid-and-morphine/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/the-dangerous-risks-of-opioid-painkillers-like-dilaudid-and-morphine/</guid><description>A trial started this week in a Waco, McLennan County state court for a wrongful death medical malpractice lawsuit brought by a former chaplain at Hillcrest Baptist Medical Center.

This has led many doctors to come up with ways to expand into that lucrative marketplace.

The federal government realized that these medical and hospital errors were costing Medicare and Medicaid lots of extra money. As a result, the Affordable Care Act started the Hospital-Acquired Condition Program, which monitors infection and injury rates and hits the worst-performing hospitals where they feel it: their pocketbooks.</description></item><item><title>Surgery &amp; operating room malpractice: Are the doctors in the room?</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surgery-operating-room-malpractice-are-the-doctors-in-the-room/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surgery-operating-room-malpractice-are-the-doctors-in-the-room/</guid><description>Do you ever feel like a number rather than a person when you go to a doctor&amp;rsquo;s office or hospital?

Unfortunately, when medical malpractice happens in a Navy, Army, or Air Force hospital, the victims often feel isolated.

In the time period of 2000 through 2009, there was an increase of 28 million annual emergency room visits in the United States.

Hi, I&amp;#39;m Robert Painter. Today I want to talk to you about brain injuries, and one specific tip on how you can avoid brain injuries during a hospitalization.
There are a lot of ways we can injure our heads or experience a brain injury. It could be in a football game - getting a concussion. I&amp;#39;ve had clients who have fallen off horses. But something that I&amp;#39;ve seen happen with an increasing frequency over the last few years would be people who are patients in a hospital doing fine recovering, but they end up having a brain injury because of the nursing and doctor care.</description></item><item><title>Video: Brachial plexus injuries/Erb's Palsy from birth</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/video-brachial-plexus-injuries/erbs-palsy-from-birth/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/video-brachial-plexus-injuries/erbs-palsy-from-birth/</guid><description>Video transcript:
Hi Robert Painter, and today we are going to be talking about a birth injury called Erb&amp;#39;s palsy, or also known as a brachial plexus injury.
Now the brachial plexus refers to a bundle of nerves that is found in on both sides of our bodies, really in the armpit area. Now during the birth process those nerves can get injured, and those can have devastating effects because the brachial plexus takes care of the motor, or the movement, function, in our arms, as well as the in sensation we have in this whole area - and even into the chest to some extent.</description></item><item><title>Video: Prenatal visits and fundal height measurement can save lives</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/video-prenatal-visits-and-fundal-height-measurement-can-save-lives/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/video-prenatal-visits-and-fundal-height-measurement-can-save-lives/</guid><description>Today we&amp;rsquo;re going to speak about something that happens in every prenatal visit&amp;mdash;or at least it should in any prenatal visit with an OB/GYN&amp;mdash;and that&amp;rsquo;s the fundal height measurement.

That sentence grabbed my attention when I read it in a neurologist&amp;rsquo;s report about our client. Let&amp;rsquo;s call him Rigo.
What is TPA?
TPA, or tissue plasminogen activator, is a drug that physicians can order for eligible patients who are having an ischemic stroke. Most strokes are ischemic, meaning they&amp;rsquo;re caused when a clot forms, dislodges, and blocks a blood vessel to the brain.</description></item><item><title>Video: Holiday seasons see an increase in dangerous hospital errors</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/video-holiday-seasons-see-an-increase-in-dangerous-hospital-errors/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/video-holiday-seasons-see-an-increase-in-dangerous-hospital-errors/</guid><description>With the holiday season upon us there are two things I want to talk to you about today that can keep you and your family safe when it comes to hospitalizations.
Number one, if you can avoid a hospitalization during the holiday season, you should do it as much as possible.

Sometimes, though, I believe patients would be better off going home. Let me explain why.
I have handled a number of medical malpractice lawsuits concerning rehabilitation hospitals like the Triumph/Kindred system and Reliant Rehabilitation. One of the common themes I see in these cases is very limited physician involvement in the care that is provided.</description></item><item><title>Holidays are a good time to avoid hospitals</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/holidays-are-a-good-time-to-avoid-hospitals/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/holidays-are-a-good-time-to-avoid-hospitals/</guid><description>Have you ever noticed that any time you or family member gets sick, it seems to happen on an evening, weekend or holiday? That certainly seems how it goes in our family. Did you know, though, that during these times the risk of medical and nursing errors in the hospital is much higher than normal?
If possible, avoid hospitals on weekends, evenings and holidays

There are many types of infections that we commonly hear about, including staph infections, MRSA infections (methicillin-resistant staph aureus), bedsores and infected catheters or lines.
It is always a serious matter when a patient has an active infection. Prompt diagnosis is important because the faster treatment begins, the more likely the infection can be killed and the patient can go on with his or her life.</description></item><item><title>Three secrets about how hospitals and doctors hide their past mistakes from the public</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/three-secrets-about-how-hospitals-and-doctors-hide-their-past-mistakes-from-the-public/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/three-secrets-about-how-hospitals-and-doctors-hide-their-past-mistakes-from-the-public/</guid><description>There is not a week that goes by when a client does not ask me &amp;ldquo;Has the doctor done this to anyone else?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Why did the hospital let the doctor practice at its facility?&amp;rdquo;

Unfortunately, many Texans are not compensated for their legitimate, catastrophic injuries (or the death of a family member) caused by hospitals, doctors and nurses because of this law. In fact, very often Texans cannot find an attorney to accept their medical malpractice or wrongful death cases at all because of this law.</description></item><item><title>Painter Law Firm files suit for family against First Colony Health and Rehabilitation Center</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/painter-law-firm-files-suit-for-family-against-first-colony-health-and-rehabilitation-center/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Feb 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/painter-law-firm-files-suit-for-family-against-first-colony-health-and-rehabilitation-center/</guid><description>Painter Law Firm filed a lawsuit in Houston, Texas against First Colony Health and Rehabilitation Center and a physician, on behalf of the family of Bernice Twardowski.

It usually happens like this.
A doctor orders some lab work or a radiological study, like a CT scan or MRI. After the results are in, a nurse, lab tech or radiology tech does not information the physician who ordered the study.

Session after session, the Texas legislature has failed to amend it despite a terrible controversy over the provisions governing end-of-life care.
As it stands now, hospital committees, not patients and their families, have the ultimate say-so in whether a person receives curative care, food and water&amp;mdash;in other words, they make the &amp;#39;life and death&amp;#39; decision.
Plus, the due process provisions of the law are dubious: (1) Hospitals only need to give a patient and family 48-hours&amp;#39; notice of the committee meeting.</description></item><item><title>Instead of pointing fingers at each other, doctors and nurses need to focus on patient care and safety</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/instead-of-pointing-fingers-at-each-other-doctors-and-nurses-need-to-focus-on-patient-care-and-safety/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/instead-of-pointing-fingers-at-each-other-doctors-and-nurses-need-to-focus-on-patient-care-and-safety/</guid><description>Study after study has shown that one of the biggest contributors to medical errors and negligence is poor communication among healthcare providers.

Many Texans are surprised to learn that the Advance Directives Act of 1999 allows a hospital committee to act as a &amp;#39;death panel&amp;#39; that can override a patient or family&amp;#39;s treatment wishes, even to the point of withholding care, treatment, food and water from a patient.</description></item><item><title>Medicare: 1 in 7 patients is harmed during hospitalization</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/medicare-1-in-7-patients-is-harmed-during-hospitalization/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/medicare-1-in-7-patients-is-harmed-during-hospitalization/</guid><description>According to a new report by the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, about 15,000 Medicare patients per month experience a complication or error while hospitalized that contributes to death.
During the month-long study that was the basis for the report, 134,000 Medicare patients suffered at least one adverse event while hospitalized, and an astounding 44 percent of those errors were preventable.
Dr. Donald Berwick, a patient safety advocate, seemed to suggest that the best way to avoid hospital errors is to avoid hospitals.</description></item><item><title>Surgical errors can be reduced with a simple checklist</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surgical-errors-can-be-reduced-with-a-simple-checklist/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Oct 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/surgical-errors-can-be-reduced-with-a-simple-checklist/</guid><description>Unfortunately many hospitals, nurses and physicians have poor communication practices. Time and time again studies have shown that poor communications increase medical errors and patient deaths.
As a Texas medical malpractice lawyer, I frequently see cases in which doctors give orders, hospital nursing or technical staff do not complete the orders, and doctors do not check back for the results.
Without appropriate &amp;#39;hand off&amp;#39; communications (as required by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations) or follow-up by a physician, quite often the patient suffers harm.</description></item><item><title>National College of Advocacy recognizes Robert Painter</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/national-college-of-advocacy-recognizes-robert-painter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Sep 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/national-college-of-advocacy-recognizes-robert-painter/</guid><description>On September 7, 2010, the American Association for Justice National College of Advocacy recognized Robert Painter as an &amp;#39;Advocate&amp;#39;.

There is another big problem in the pain management field, the so-called &amp;#39;pill mills.&amp;#39; There are over 200 so-called pain clinics in Houston alone, and many of them are &amp;#39;supervised&amp;#39; by absentee physicians who are rarely on site, and dispense powerful drugs without a physical exam.</description></item><item><title>Texas hospital-doctor conspiracy of silence exposed</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-hospital-doctor-conspiracy-of-silence-exposed/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Aug 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/texas-hospital-doctor-conspiracy-of-silence-exposed/</guid><description>Almost every day I see examples of the &amp;#39;conspiracy of silence&amp;#39; in the medical community. Hospitals, nurses, and doctors see patients injured by the negligence of other health care providers, but do not want to say anything. In the tight-nit healh care community, there is frequent mentality of &amp;#39;covering each other&amp;#39;s back.&amp;#39;
An editorial in the Houston Chronicle provided an excellent example of this problem.

At that point, a doctor can &amp;ldquo;hang a shingle&amp;rdquo; and start practicing medicine. Hospitals have the responsibility for verifying the licensure status and competence of physicians they allow to practice in their facilities through a process called credentialing.
Hospitals credential doctors to practice in certain areas of medicine or to perform specific procedures or surgeries.</description></item><item><title>'Stat' means 'now': How hospitals bungle urgent CT and MRI orders</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/stat-means-now-how-hospitals-bungle-urgent-ct-and-mri-orders/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jul 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/stat-means-now-how-hospitals-bungle-urgent-ct-and-mri-orders/</guid><description>A doctor orders radiology studies for a patient when a physical exam suggests a preliminary diagnosis but additional information is necessary to be certain. Having the correct diagnosis is essential for selecting the correct treatment.
Frequently, a doctor orders a radiology scan, like computer aided tomography (CT or &amp;ldquo;CAT scan&amp;rdquo;) or magnetic resonance image (MRI), when he or she needs detailed information about an internal part of the body.
After the CT or MRI is ordered, a nurse or hospital administrative staff gets the order to a radiology department.</description></item><item><title>Poor nursing communication causes needless hospital injuries and deaths</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/poor-nursing-communication-causes-needless-hospital-injuries-and-deaths/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jun 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/poor-nursing-communication-causes-needless-hospital-injuries-and-deaths/</guid><description>When a patient is admitted to a hospital one of the most important factors for achieving treatment goals is competent nursing care.
Physicians perform assessments and make orders, and most often then delegate it to the nursing staff to monitor the patient, follow the orders, and report back when there are any changes in the patient&amp;rsquo;s status.
For nurses to be able to fulfill this role, hospitals must be serious about their role to hire only qualified nurses and then to use proper testing and assessment to ensure that those nurses have the skills to take care of particular types of patients.</description></item><item><title>Painter Law Firm wins medical malpractice settlement of $3,925,000</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/painter-law-firm-wins-medical-malpractice-settlement-of-3925000/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jun 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/painter-law-firm-wins-medical-malpractice-settlement-of-3925000/</guid><description>Painter Law Firm attorney Robert Painter recently settled a Houston medical malpractice lawsuit for $3,925,000.

Hyponatremia is a condition where a person develops a low serum sodium level. It is fairly common among runners who get dehydrated.

The balance of power between patients and physicians about end-of-life health care decisions has seesawed over the years. The development of "advance directives," led to a nationwide shift in favor of patients. Advance directives allow patients the opportunity to convey end-of-life decisions prior to a need arising. In Texas, these patient rights have diminished as legislators focus on development and implementation of the futility review process that authorizes health-care providers to have the final say under certain circumstances.</description></item><item><title>Death panels already exist</title><link>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/death-panels-already-exist/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jan 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://painterfirm.com/medmal/death-panels-already-exist/</guid><description>This op-ed was published in the August 19, 2009 edition of The Washington Times.
Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who says President Obama&amp;#39;s heath care reform would result in "death panels," needs to look no further than Texas to see a slippery slope like the one she envisions.
In Texas, a legislative provision that many thought was an innocuous proposal to help people has been twisted to snatch end-of-life decisions out of the hands of families.</description></item></channel></rss>
